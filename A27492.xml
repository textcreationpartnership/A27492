            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Hope, it will appear, that there are many things in theſe Lives of that great Moment, and <hi>which are no where elſe in the World to be found,</hi> that This Publication of them will not be unacceptable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Reader. They are the moſt Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick accounts of the Princes of whom they ſpeak, that are Extant to us at this day. I had almoſt ſaid, they are the very only Hiſtories which we have of them. For <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Eutropius</hi> give us no Better than a few Sketches upon them. <hi>Herodian</hi> begins a great deal too late, and ends a great deal too ſoon for the Reigns of many of theſe Princes; and <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> Concludes his Hiſtory with his own Conſulſhip under <hi>Alexander Severus.</hi> Neither is <hi>Herodian.</hi> in what he ſays, much leſs the Imperfect Part of <hi>Dion Caſſius,</hi> ſo Particular and
<pb facs="tcp:52508:5"/> of that Latitude, as the Method is, that is taken by theſe Hiſtorians: and therefore whoever would inform himſelf, or the world, of the Lives and Actions of theſe Princes, he Unavoidably comes hither for his Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and all that any of the Moderns have done, or can do, upon the ſame Subject, is, to gather from this Stock, and Glean from this Harveſt.</p>
            <p>This I preſume is enough for me to ſay, to repreſent at once the Authority, and the Value of the <hi>Auguſtéan</hi> Hiſtorians. They were Perſons, who were Employed upon what they did by the Command of the Emperors, to whom they Dedicate; and I take that to be a very good reaſon to think, that they took all the care they could of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and that they had the Reputation in their own Age of being None of the worſt Hands.</p>
            <p>Yet it is very certain, that the Originals are ſtrangely Coarſe, and wonderfully Rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. The Learned <hi>Salmaſius, Caſaubon,</hi> and <hi>Gruterus,</hi> but eſpecially the two firſt, have beſtowed incredible Pains upon them, to make them intelligible. The Text, and the Manuſcripts out of which the Text hath been Printed, are all ſo very Vitious. But there is no Neceſſity, that I ſhould Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb facs="tcp:52508:5"/> here, all that I have obſerved as to thoſe Matters. I muſt confeſs, it hath been a Work of no ſmall difficulty to me to Tranſlate them. So obſcure and dark as they are in their own Language, it was almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make them ſhine in another. But yet when I obſerved, how very much theſe Lives have been long wanting to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and no Collections I thought out of them could be ſo ſatisfactory, nor comparable with the Original; I was pleaſed, that I had choſe the Part that would be the moſt beneficial to the Reader, although at the ſame time it was the moſt painful to me.</p>
            <p>In what manner I have acquitted my ſelf, I muſt leave it to his Candor, and to his Goodneſs to determine. I have endeavoured to make both the Language and the Story ſo Eaſie and ſo Natural, by the Liberty that I take, and which I think is no more than juſt, that whilſt they are in the Original ſome of the difficulteſt Books in the World, he that Runs may Read them here, and there is no need of the leaſt Notes to Explain any thing. I have for the moſt part given to Places the Modern Names, under which they are now known to us: except when it is inconſiſtent with the Modern Geography ſo to do, or when they are ſuch Places, as have been long
<pb facs="tcp:52508:6"/> Extinct, and we have no modern Names for them. Nor is the Reader to be ſurpriſed, if he ſhould ſee the City of <hi>Byzantium</hi> called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> even before <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> This is a Soleciſm in point of time. But I ſtand not upon that, when I conſider; that howſoever my Authors writ to the Ages long ſince paſt, yet I do tranſlate them to my own.</p>
            <p>There is a Queſtion amongſt the Criticks, but of not much more moment, than generally the Queſtions of thoſe Gentlemen are; whether the ſeveral Perſons, to whoſe Names theſe Lives are attributed as the Authors, were really the Authors of them or not; and whether <hi>Aelius Spartian</hi> and <hi>Aelius Lampridius</hi> be not the ſame Perſon under three Names; becauſe <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius</hi> ſays, that in the <hi>Palatine</hi> Manuſcript, all the Lives of the firſt Volume, contrary to the Example of other Manuſcripts, and to the received Opinion, are attributed to the Name of <hi>Spartianus.</hi> Now, as to this, I need ſay no more, than that I cannot think, that <hi>Spartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was the Author of all the firſt Volume, for this Reaſon; becauſe the ſame Perſon would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have made ſo many Repetitions: And ſo it ſeems the moſt probable to me to be, that each Part was written by the Hand that it pretends to; but yet all, or however, moſt of them, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a common Conſent, and Undertaking of the Authors, one amongſt another.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52508:6"/>
            <p>One thing there is, wherein I crave the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty farther to ſpeak my Opinion, as to the Praiſe of theſe Authors. The Acts which they have faithfully extracted out of the Journal of the Senate, and out of the <hi>Ulpian</hi> Library; the <hi>Bitter Exclamations of the Senate againſt the Memories of their evil Princes, and their Applauſes of their good Ones;</hi> the Letters and Speeches which are Here, not as in other Hiſtorians invented, but all true Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals; Theſe I ſay, I think, are ſuch Beauties, as are not to be parallell'd out of the beſt of the Antients, that have ever writ the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
            <p>The Lives of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> I have tranſlated from the Original Greek of <hi>Dion Caſſius:</hi> He being the only Hiſtorian of the Antients, that are now extant, that hath them. And it was neceſſary that thoſe Two Lives ſhould be premiſed to the reſt, to make the Line of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors perfect, from the end of <hi>Suetonius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where the <hi>Auguſtéan</hi> Hiſtorians have themſelves ended, I have been obliged to adjoyn a few Collections of my own, for the Lives of <hi>Diocleſian, Maximian, Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Galerius:</hi> Becauſe we have no antient Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals left us of thoſe Emperors; and to end with <hi>Carinus,</hi> it was thought improper, it
<pb facs="tcp:52508:7"/> being no period; whereas the Addition of thoſe Four, after him, brings down the Account en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unto <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Regulate the better the whole, I have added a Chronology for the ſatisfaction of any who ſhall be pleaſed to turn to it.</p>
            <p>The Extract out of the Learned <hi>Voſſius,</hi> which follows, prevents me in the reſt, that I might have to offer; it was done to my hand, by an ingenious Gentleman.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, that after I had entirely finiſhed this Tranſlation, I received a <hi>French</hi> one, made about thirty Years ago by the <hi>Abbé de Villeloin,</hi> a great Writer, who dedicates it to the <hi>French</hi> King; and, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, takes the Liberty to ſay, that it is the Tenth Book which he hath had the Honour to dedicate to him. It begins but with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> and ends with <hi>Carinus.</hi> I peruſed it, and compared Mine with it; and I ſhall be glad, if this may be ſomething the better for that Labour.</p>
            <p>Theſe Hiſtorians have not affected to be eloquent, but they may the more be depended upon for the Truth.</p>

                     <p>AFTER the Death of <hi>Domitian,</hi> the Senate ſet up <hi>Cocceius Nerva</hi> to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon the Throne of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Statues of <hi>Domitian</hi> which were of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,<note place="margin">Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an'<hi>s Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd.</hi>
                        </note> and others which were of Gold, as he had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52508:10"/> many of both, were out of hatred to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory melted down: A great quantity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was made of them, and the many trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Arches were deſtroyed that had been erected to his Glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nerva</hi> remitted the Perſecution which was<note place="margin">Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chriſtians remitted.</note> raiſed againſt the Chriſtians by <hi>Domitian,</hi> and pardon'd ſuch as ſtood Condemned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called home others that were fled. He put to Death all the Slaves and Servants, who had taken the Advantage of that Reign, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, to ſeek the Lives of their Maſters. He ordered, that that Rank of People ſhould not be heard in any Accuſation againſt their Maſters at all. He ordered, that none ſhould be Proſecuted for being either of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Chriſtians, or that of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But yet as he was a Prince who was ſlack in his Government, many Perſons were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding upon the Accuſations of Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants condemned, and particularly <hi>Suras</hi> a Philoſopher, was one of this number.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Correction which he took of the ill Miniſters of the laſt Reign, and the Liberties which he gave in his own, were an occaſion that the Mouths of all the People were opened againſt one another, till <hi>Rome</hi> was in a Mutiny; hereupon <hi>Tirenta</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul ſaid, <hi>It is ill when a Prince ties up the People ſo, that there is no Liberty of any thing for any one; but yet a Liberty for every thing for every one is worſe than none. Nerva</hi> was made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it, and gave Orders for the time to come, to redreſs it.</p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52508:10"/>
                     <p>He was Old when he came to the Empire, and very weak and infirm. His Stomach ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom retain'd what he eat. He allowed no<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Nerva.</note> Statues of him to be ſet up either in Silver or Gold. All the Goods about the Court, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch as had been injured by <hi>Domitian,</hi> he reſtored to the Owners. He gave Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Seſtertiums</hi> to be laid out upon a Purchaſe of Land to be divided amongſt the Poor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he appointed ſome of the Senators to buy it, and to make the Diſtribution. His Coffers being empty, he ſold a great many rich Robes, and Plate, and Furniture both of what was his own before his elevation, and of the Furniture Royal, ſeveral Eſtates alſo, and Houſes, and in general, all things, except the Neceſſaries that he could not be without. He was not difficult in the Prices for which he ſold them. He did a kindneſs to many in the Peny-worths that he gave them. He took away divers Sacrifices, Races of the <hi>Cirque,</hi> and other publick Shews to ſave Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and retrench his Expences as much as he could.</p>
                     <p>He aſſured the Senate upon his Oath, <hi>That he never would be that Prince who ſhould ſpill the Blood of any Senator.</hi> Which Oath he kept, notwithſtanding the Conſpiracy afterwards form'd againſt him, which might well have provoked him to other Sentiments. He did nothing without the Counſel of the Great Men. He made ſeveral Laws. Amongſt the reſt, he made a Law, <hi>To forbid the Gelding of any one for an Eunuch;</hi> and another, <hi>That no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52508:11"/> body ſhould Marry his Brother's, or his Siſter's Daughter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He appointed <hi>Virginius Rufus</hi> to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Makes</hi> Viginius <hi>his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league.</hi>
                        </note> in conjunction with himſelf, although <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginius Rufus</hi> was one, who when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in <hi>Germany,</hi> and had overcome <hi>Vindex</hi> in the time of <hi>Nero,</hi> had been often importuned by the Army to take upon him the Empire, which he refuſed. In Honour whereof, it was written afterwards upon his Tomb when he died, That <hi>overthrowing</hi> Vindex, <hi>he had aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Empire, not to himſelf, but to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;</hi> whoſe Service, ſignifying, he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely regarded without any Ambition in it of his own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nerva</hi> comported himſelf in his Reign in that manner, that he ſometime ſaid, <hi>He had done nothing to make him think, but that he could reſign the Empire, and lead a private Life again in Safety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Calphurnius Craſſus</hi> of the famous Family of the <hi>Craſſi,</hi> had with ſome others confederated<note place="margin">Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt him.</note> in a Plot againſt him, which he was made acquainted with, to them unknown. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them, and placed them by his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at a Shew of the Combats of the <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators</hi> in the <hi>Cirque;</hi> where he took up the Weapons, as if it were only to ſee if they were ſharp, as is uſual, and then he gave them out of his Hand into the Hands of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators. <hi>What think you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will not theſe do? Are they not ſharp enough?</hi> He intended this as a ſecret Reflection to them of his knowledge of that Deſign of theirs, and at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52508:11"/> the ſame time he ſeemed to ſhew ſuch a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of his Life, as if he did not care tho' they killed him upon the place.</p>
                     <p>The Captain of the Guards under him was <hi>Caſperius Aelianus,</hi> who was the ſame before under <hi>Domitian.</hi> This Officer ſet the Soldiers againſt <hi>Nerva,</hi> and work'd them to a heighth, that they demanded the Heads of ſeveral that were about his Perſon, to which <hi>Nerva</hi> oppoſed himſelf ſo, that ſtripping bare his Boſom, and offering it bare to them in a Paſſion, ſays he, <hi>Take my Life, not theirs.</hi> However, this did not ſave them, for as many as <hi>Caſperius Aelianus</hi> had mark'd out, fell a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Pleaſure of the Guards.</p>
                     <p>The Age of <hi>Nerva</hi> was one thing which loſt him much Reſpect. After this Action of the Guards, he went to the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared<note place="margin">
                           <hi>He adopts</hi> Trajan.</note> his Adoption of <hi>Marcus Ulpius Trajan</hi> with a loud Voice thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Together with my hearty Wiſhes for the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Senate and People of</hi> Rome, <hi>and that what I do may be Happy to them and my ſelf; I make</hi> Marcus Ulpius Trajan <hi>my Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then he created him in the Senate his <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> which is the Title of a Perſon when he is choſen to ſucceed in the Empire; and having done this, he wrote to <hi>Trajan,</hi> who at that time commanded in <hi>Germany,</hi> with his own Hand, amongſt other things a <hi>Greek</hi> Verſe out of <hi>Homer,</hi>
                        <q>

                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52508:12"/> by which he ſeemed to ſignifie, that he left it to him to do him Juſtice, and to revenge him of that Mutiny of the Guards.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Trajan</hi> was appointed to ſucceed to the Empire, even in preference to <hi>Nerva</hi>'s own Relations; whereof there were ſome whom he might have ſo honoured, if he had not been a Man who regarded the Good of the Publick above the Conſideration of his Blood. Nor did it incline him the leſs to what he did, to know, that <hi>Trajan</hi> was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> neither an <hi>Italian,</hi> nor of <hi>Italian</hi> born Parents; and that no Alien, as he was, had ever poſſeſſed the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire before. For he conſidered, That it was the Worth and not the Countrey of any one that was the thing, which he ought to reſpect. After which <hi>Nerva</hi> died, having Reigned one Year, four Months, and nine Days: And lived ſixty<note place="margin">His Death.</note> five Years, ten Months, and ten Days.</p>

                        <p>AS <hi>Nerva</hi> was a Perſon of very great Worth and Honour, he was offered the Empire before <hi>Domitian</hi> was killed, by the ſame Party, who to ſave their Lives, becauſe they found that they were privately mark'd out for the Slaughter by <hi>Domitian,</hi> made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Maſters of the Life of that Prince. He was alſo as much under Danger from that Prince, as they, which made him the more eaſy to be perſuaded to accept their Offer, and to run their hazards. For the Aſtrologers,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52508:12"/> with whom <hi>Domitian</hi> had adviſed about the Nativities of Great Men, had accuſed <hi>Nerva</hi> as one that was to be ſuſpected of having an Eye upon the Empire.

                     <byline>BY DIO CASSIUS: <hi>Rom. Hiſt.</hi> Lib. 68.</byline>
                     <p>
                        <hi>TRAJAN,</hi> before he was Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had a Dream, which ſeemed to tell him, that the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> had Choſe him, and Seal'd him, as it were for their own. A Perſon in the like Dreſs and<note place="margin">Trajan'<hi>s Dream.</hi>
                        </note> Form of one, that in Picture the Senate is repreſented by, that is, in a Robe of State guarded with purple, a Veſt purled with large
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52508:14"/> Knaps of purple, a Crown upon his Head, a little elderly, came to him, he dream'd, and with a Seal which he had in a Ring, ſealed him now on the right and now on the left Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>He wrote to the Senate after he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Emperor, ſeveral things with his own Hand, and amongſt the reſt, he aſſured them of this; That <hi>the Blood of no Man, who was an honeſt Man, ſhould ever be ſpilt by him, neither ſhould he be touch'd in his Fortunes or Honour.</hi> He aſſured them of this upon his Oath, and not only then, but he repeated the ſame to them at other times.</p>
                     <p>He ſent for <hi>Aelianus Caſperius,</hi> together with<note place="margin">He puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes the old Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers.</note> ſuch of the Soldiers of the Guards, as had mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined againſt <hi>Nerva,</hi> as though it were upon ſome Buſineſs to employ them. But he did not ſuffer their Crime and the Murders which they had committed to paſs unpuniſhed, for he put them to Death.</p>
                     <p>When he came to <hi>Rome</hi> he altered ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things for the greater Good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and in the Favour of Perſons who had deſerved well. He ſhewed himſelf particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful of the Cities of <hi>Italy.</hi> He ſettled Alms and Penſions towards the Maintenance of Children of poor Families, and did a great deal of Good of that nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plotina</hi> his Empreſs, at her firſt entrance<note place="margin">His Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</note> into the Imperial Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> turned her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Steps to the People and ſaid, <hi>I go in here the ſame as I would wiſh my ſelf to come out again;</hi> and through her whole Reign
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52508:14"/> ſhe preſerved her eſteem with a Conduct which was without Reproach.</p>
                     <p>After ſome ſtay at <hi>Rome, Trajan</hi> undertook an Expedition againſt the People of <hi>Dacia;</hi> unto which he was provoked by the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that People who had augmented their Forces, and were become inſolent; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney beſides which was paid to them every Year, and with which the <hi>Romans</hi> bought their Obedience, was a Burther, that <hi>Trajan</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to throw off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Decebalus</hi> the King of <hi>Dacia</hi> was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> Daci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>War.</hi>
                        </note> apprehenſive of a War made upon him under the Conduct of a Prince ſo formidable. He was ſenſible that he had another Force, and another Perſon to deal with, than when he had overthrown <hi>Domitian.</hi> For <hi>Trajan</hi> was a Prince with whom the <hi>Roman</hi> State intirely accorded. A Prince that excelled in Juſtice,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Character of</hi> Trajan.</note> Gallantry and Integrity of Life: Strong; in Body: In the Forty ſecond Year of his Age when he began his Reign: In the full Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of his Mind: Paſt the Raſhneſs of Youth, and not yet arrived to any thing of the feebleneſs of old Age. He was one, who envied no Man, and diſobliged no Man. All ſuch as he found were really deſerving, he eſteemed and preferred. The Eſtates of Men, no leſs than their Lives, remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd by him. If he ſpent much Money upon his Wars, he ſpent much alſo to adorn the Times of Peace. This is ſeen in the Roads, Ports, and publick Edifices which are his, and which are great and neceſſary Works. As he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52508:15"/> was by Nature of a Temper to appear in what he did, Great and Magnanimous; he rebuilt the <hi>Cirque,</hi> which was decay'd, much larger than it was before, and more Beautiful. He wrote an Inſcription upon it to ſignify, that he<note place="margin">
                           <hi>His Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption on the</hi> Cirque</note> had done it ſo, <hi>to make it worthy to receive the People of</hi> Rome. He deſired rather to be loved than Adored. He was affable to the People, and reſpectful to the Senate. All loved him. None dreaded him but the Enemy. He Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he Feaſted with his Miniſters, Viſited their Offices, Jeſted with them: Many times ſate amongſt them in the fourth Place; came to their Houſes without a Guard, and made his Converſation pleaſant. Tho' he was not one who was ſtudied in all Parts of Learning, yet he acquitted himſelf in that reſpect very well; every thing he did was Excellent. I know that he was given to love Boys, and to Drink; and had he been guilty of any thing in either reſpect that is Baſe, he would have been to be blamed. But in Drinking he went not to exceſs, and as to his love of the Boys, he forced or injured no one. He loved War; yet when he had adjuſted Affairs, and weakened the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and increaſed his Alliances, he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. No ſuch thing ever befel him, as is commonly happens to others that command Armies; that is, for the Soldiers to Mutiny and be Inſolent. This was a Happineſs owing to the Excellency of his Conduct, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the King of <hi>Dacia</hi> feared him, it was not without reaſon.</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52508:15"/>
                     <p>As he was upon his March againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and near the place where they lay, ſome body had pretended to cut upon a large Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, which was brought to him, with words in <hi>Latin,</hi> ſignifying, That <hi>others of his Allies, and particularly the</hi> Byrrhi, <hi>who bordered upon</hi> Dacia, <hi>adviſed him to make a Peace with the Enemy, and retire.</hi> But yet this did not hinder, but<note place="margin">He fights the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> he began the Fight, in which many of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy were killed, and many of his own Men were wounded; to bind up whoſe Wounds he did not ſpare to tear his own Cloaths into Rags for Binders to give them; and for others of his Men that were killed, he built an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and ordered that there ſhould be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices every Year offered thereupon in their Honour.</p>
                     <p>He purſued his Blow, directing his March over the Hills and Mountains from one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, not without great danger, till he came up to the Capital City of <hi>Dacia,</hi> whilſt <hi>Lucius</hi> employed the Enemy on another ſide, and killed and took great Numbers of them.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Decebalus</hi> ſent to <hi>Trajan</hi> to deſire Peace, by ſome of his chief Officers, who<note place="margin">Decebalus <hi>deſires Peace.</hi>
                        </note> coming into his Preſence, laid down their Arms, and proſtrated themſelves upon the Ground before him, and ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Decebalus <hi>did above all things covet the Honour to come and confer with him in Perſon, being ready on his Part to receive all his Commands. But if this was otherwiſe to be reſolved on, he deſired that ſome Perſons might be ſent to him with Powers to Treat a Peace. Suras,</hi> and <hi>Claudius Livianus,</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52508:16"/> the Captain of the Guards, were ſent from <hi>Trajan</hi> upon this Subject; who were met by others on the ſide of <hi>Decebalus.</hi> But nothing being concluded, becauſe <hi>Decebalus</hi> refuſed to appear, <hi>Trajan</hi> took his Caſtles, and therein his Arms, Artillery and Stores, together with a <hi>Roman</hi> Standard which had been loſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly under <hi>Fuſcus.</hi> A Siſter of <hi>Decebalus</hi> fell at the ſame time a Priſoner into the Hands of <hi>Maximus;</hi> and a ſtrong Town in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was taken by the ſame. All which coming upon the heels of one another, <hi>Decebalus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected himſelf again, and intirely complied<note place="margin">Decebalus <hi>ſubmits.</hi>
                        </note> with the Conditions that were offer'd him. He promiſed to deliver up his Arms, Artillery, the Artificers that made them, and the Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that had run over to him: To diſmantle his Fortreſſes, retire from the Land that he had taken from his Neighbours, and have the ſame Friends and Enemies with the People of <hi>Rome:</hi> To entertain no Deſerters, and to take no Soldiers into his Service, out of Places in the Dominions of the <hi>Romans;</hi> becauſe moſt of his beſt Men were ſuch, as he had inticed into his Service from thence. All which he promiſed, againſt his Mind, and being conducted to an Interview with <hi>Trajan,</hi> he threw himſelf upon the Ground and adored him.</p>
                     <p>He ſent to the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, to have the ſame Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from them, that he had made with <hi>Trajan.</hi> The Embaſſadors were introduced into the Senate, where they laid down their Arms upon the Ground, and ſtanding before
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52508:16"/> the Senate with their Hands within their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as if they were Captives, they ſpoke in Terms of great Submiſſion to the Senate, who ratified the Peace, and then they took up their Arms again. <hi>Warhel</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Dacia</hi> received a Garriſon of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and the reſt of the Countrey being ſerved accordingly, <hi>Trajan</hi> returned back to <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was received in Triumph, and the Title<note place="margin">Trajan'<hi>s Triumph.</hi>
                        </note> of the <hi>Conquerour of Dacia</hi> was given him, and inſerted into his Stile. The Combats of the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> in which he delighted, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of the Stage in which <hi>Pylades</hi> was one that gained much of his Favour; were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for his Entertainment. Though he was a Military Prince, he took never the leſs Care of the Civil Policy, and minded the Affairs of Peace and Juſtice. In the <hi>Forum</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or in the <hi>Portico</hi> of <hi>Livia,</hi> or in other Places, he many times aſſiſted in Perſon at the Cauſes which were pleaded there.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Decebalus</hi> could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade<note place="margin">Decebalus <hi>renews the War.</hi>
                        </note> himſelf to keep the Conditions of the Peace which he had made. He proceeded to raiſe Men, provide Arms, entertain Deſerters, re-fortify his Caſtles, and invite the Nations that were his Neighbours to joyn with him, to whom he repreſented; <hi>That if he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by them now, their own Ruine was the next thing to follow. It was eaſier, and the ſafeſt way for them,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>to preſerve their Liberties, by ſtanding all by one another whilſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52508:17"/> they might, for the Common Defence, than it would be to do this after</hi> Decebalus <hi>was ruined, which would open a Gap to the Enemy to devour them one by one.</hi> Purſuant to this, he began the War by falling upon ſuch as had appear'd againſt him in the former War, and by poſſeſſing himſelf of a part of the Countrey of the <hi>Jazyges,</hi> which was upon the <hi>Danube</hi> towards <hi>Dacia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Senate declared <hi>Decebalus</hi> again an Enemy, and <hi>Trajan</hi> without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the War to another, went in Perſon to reduce him a ſecond time. He marched againſt him with an Army which <hi>Decebalus</hi> was in an ill Condition by fair Force to reſiſt; but by Deceit and Treachery, he was within a<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Treachery of</hi> Deceba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus <hi>defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                        </note> little of effecting that, that he could not by his Arms. He ſent Perſons under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Deſerters into <hi>Moeſia</hi> to aſſaſſine him, as <hi>Trajan</hi> was always eaſie of acceſs; but then more particularly upon the Incidents of the War, any one was admitted to ſpeak to him. That which diſappointed this Deſign was, one of the Conſpirators was taken up on ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and put to the Torture, who confeſſed the whole Plot.</p>
                     <p>There was a Commander of a Legion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army of great Skill, and who had<note place="margin">Longinus <hi>trapan'd.</hi>
                        </note> often ſignalized himſelf in the Wars againſt <hi>Dacia,</hi> called <hi>Longinus; Decebalus</hi> found means by Treachery to get this Colonel into his hands, and then ſent to <hi>Trajan</hi> to tell him, <hi>That upon Condition the Countrey as far as the</hi> Danube, <hi>might be reſtored to him, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52508:17"/> that</hi> Trajan <hi>allowed him for the Charges of the War,</hi> he courted his Friendſhip, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <hi>Longinus</hi> again in ſafety. To which <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> anſwered in a manner, that was to let him know, that he neither made a ſmall, nor yet ſuch a high Account of the Life of <hi>Longinus,</hi> as to buy it too dear. In the mean time, whilſt <hi>Decebalus</hi> was reſolving with himſelf what more to do, <hi>Longinus</hi> found means to procure a quantity of Poyſon by the help of a Servant, and he took it in the night and died.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trajan</hi> built a Bridge over the <hi>Danube,</hi> for<note place="margin">Trajan'<hi>s Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the</hi> Danube.</note> which I know not how I can ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him. The other Works of his are very Magnificent, but this is above them all. It is a Bridge of Nineteen Arches, all of ſquare Stone; the Heighth one Hundred and Fifty Foot above the Foundation; the Breadth Sixty Foot, and the Diſtance between each Arch one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Seventy Foot. How ſhall I admire the Charge that this coſt, and which way alſo it was poſſible to Found it in a great River, and a difficult Water which hath an ozy Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at the bottom, when in the mean time there was no turning the Stream aſide into another Chanel? The River is in other places double and treble the breadth, that it is here where this Bridge covers it. Here it is at the ſtraighteſt, and therefore ſo much the more fit place for a Bridge; but yet the Account that I have given, makes it a pretty broad Paſſage here alſo. But that which I would chiefly obſerve from the Breadth of the River
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52508:18"/> in this and in other places is, that the broader and the more ſpatious a Flood it is as it comes hither, and the broader and the greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs that it challenges as it goes from hence, ſo much the deeper and the more rapid muſt it be where it is ſtreightned in its Courſe; and this muſt make it the more difficult to cover it with a Bridge, where it is ſo deep and ſo rapid. Certainly the Greatneſs of the Soul of <hi>Trajan,</hi> ſhews it ſelf in this Work; tho' it be of no uſe to us now, nor paſſable. The Peers are yet ſtanding, which look as if they were only built to ſhew, That <hi>nothing is impoſſible to the Wit of Man.</hi> The reaſon of <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Bridge was, to paſs his Forces with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to the Succour of the <hi>Romans</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> attack'd them at a time when the River was frozen up. <hi>Hadrian</hi> fearing on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> might ſometime Force the Paſſage of this Bridge, and give themſelves an eaſie deſcent by it into the Country of <hi>Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> demoliſhed it, and broke down the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trajan</hi> paſſing his Army over the <hi>Danube</hi> by this Bridge, made rather a ſafe than a quick War, and with time and difficulty fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Conqueſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Dacia.</hi> He ſignalized his Conduct and his Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> in many things himſelf. The Soldiers by his Example were encouraged to contemn Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and acquit themſelves with Honour. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt a Horſeman who was very much wounded, was brought out of a Fight to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52508:18"/> the Surgeon to be dreſs'd; but perceiving that his Life was deſperate, and that his Wounds were uncurable, he quitted the Tent again before his Spirits failed him, and rejoyned the Battel, and died, fighting with great Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>In fine, <hi>Decebalus,</hi> after his Capital City<note place="margin">Decebalus <hi>kills him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                        </note> was loſt, and his Country all taken, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in danger to be taken, killed himſelf. His Head was brought to <hi>Rome: Dacia</hi> was made a Province of the Empire, and <hi>Trajan</hi> planted it with Colonies of <hi>Romans.</hi> He had hid his Treaſure in the Bed of the River <hi>Iſtrig,</hi> not far from <hi>Warhel.</hi> For he had made his Slaves turn<note place="margin">His hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> the Water aſide another way, and into the Channel dig a Pit, in which he buried a great deal of Gold and Silver, and precious Things that could endure the Wet, which he covered with a heap of Stones and Earth, and then brought the River to run over them in its uſual Courſe again. He hid his Robes and other things of that nature, in Caves of the Earth, by the Hands of the ſame Slaves, who when they had done their Work, were killed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould ſay nothing. But one <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilu,</hi> who was one of his Favourites, knowing the thing, and being taken Priſoner by <hi>Trajan,</hi> he diſcovered all to him, and the buried Treaſure was brought to Light again.</p>
                     <p>About this time <hi>Palmas</hi> the Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> reduced the <hi>Stony Arabia</hi> under the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Empire of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After <hi>Trajan</hi> was returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies<note place="margin">Trajan <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to</hi> Rome.</note> were ſent to him from many Nations
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52508:19"/> of the Barbarians, and amongſt the reſt from the <hi>Indians.</hi> The Publick Games and Shews were Celebrated one hundred twenty and three days together: in which eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Beaſts of all ſorts were killed, and ten thouſand Gladiators diverted the People, ſpilling their Blood over the Fenns called <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferte Palude</hi> in the <hi>Campagnia di Roma.</hi> He made Cauſeways, and built Houſes upon the Roads, and built Bridges which were very Magnificent.</p>
                     <p>He Called in, and Melted down all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed<note place="margin">

He buried <hi>Licinius Suras,</hi> when he died, with a Publick Funeral, and ſet up his Statue: who had attain'd to be ſo Rich and ſo Great, as to Found at his own Expence a Publick School for the Plays and Exerciſes of the <hi>Romans.</hi> This Perſon, and <hi>Trajan,</hi> had ſuch a Friendſhip, and ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy in one another, that many times when the Enemies of <hi>Suras,</hi> who were ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed him, had Accuſed him to <hi>Trajan, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> went nevertheleſs to his Houſe to Sup with him, Uninvited; and diſmiſſing all his Guards, Firſt he truſted himſelf to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of <hi>Suras,</hi> to do ſomething to his Eyes and Eyebrows; then he truſted himſelf to his Barber to ſhave him; For this was antiently the Cuſtom, as of all other <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo of the Emperours: For <hi>Hadrian</hi> was the firſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror that let his Beard grow unſhaved. When this was done, he waſhed, and went to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The day after he ſaid to thoſe about him, who were always ſuggeſting ſomething
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52508:19"/> ill to him of <hi>Suras, If</hi> Suras <hi>had a mind to kill me, he would have done it Yeſterday.</hi> This was a great thing in him, to truſt his Perſon in the leaſt with one, who was purſued with ſuch Accuſations. But yet it is more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, how unalterably he preſerved with him his Friendſhip, and how that nothing was able to make him believe that ever <hi>Suras</hi> would hurt him. When firſt he made him a Captain of the Guards, which is to be done by a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of delivering to him a Sword; he drew the Sword, and as he gave it, he ſaid, <hi>Take this Sword to Uſe it for me, if my Reign de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; or otherwiſe, to Uſe it againſt me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſet up the Statues of <hi>Soſſius, Palmas,</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> who were three, that he had a Favour for before others. He referred the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies at any time againſt him, to the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the Senate, by whoſe Sentence the Offenders were Puniſhed of which Number was <hi>Craſſus.</hi> He built Libraries for Books.

There was at that time a great number of Soldiers, and an extraordinary Concourſe of others from all parts in the place, either upon Buſineſs of Law, or upon Embaſſies, or Trade, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity: whereby it was ſo, That there was no Nation, nor no Province but what had a ſhare in the Calamity, and all the <hi>Roman</hi> World ſuffered in that one City. This Earthquake
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52508:22"/> was preceded by great Thunders, and unuſual Winds: but yet no body ſuſpected from thence the miſchief which followed. Firſt, a mighty<note place="margin">Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners thereof.</note> bellowing Noiſe was heard on a ſudden, from the Earth; then followed a Shock which was was ſo violent, that it made all the Earth Bounce and Swell. The Houſes Danced: ſome immediately fell with the Toſs, and broke into pieces; ſome reeled to and fro like a Ship in the Sea, and took a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs on one ſide and the other, and then fell: And the noiſe of the cracking, and burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Timber, the Brick, and Stones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, was moſt diſmal. A Duſt was raiſed, that it was impoſſible to ſee any one, or ſpeak, or be heard to ſpeak. Many who were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Houſes ſuffered. They were ſo toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, and then down again, as in a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, and ſtruck againſt one another: ſome were wounded, ſome killed. Trees were torn up from the Roots. But of the reſt, who were overtaken within their Houſes, an infinite number periſhed; a great many with the Houſes falling upon their Heads; a great many were ſuffocated under the Ruins: Others, who were held under the Wood and Stones ſo, by any part of their Bodies, that they could not poſſibly recover themſelves, were in the higheſt degree miſerable: they could not live, and yet they could not ſoon expire. If, out of ſuch an infinite number as were overtaken within their Houſes, ſeveral eſcaped with their lives, yet they were generally hurt; their Legs broken, or their Arms, or their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52508:23"/> Heads, or they vomited Blood. <hi>Pedo</hi> the Conſul was one of theſe, who died ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Whilſt ſome were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately killed, and buried under the Ruins, others were ſtarved to death, who were pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up in any void Spaces left by the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or betwixt Pillars, and in Vaults. After the Earthquake was ceaſed, a Perſon who had the Courage to go preſently upon the Ruins, heard the Voice of a Woman crying. Nor was ſhe alone: the ſucking Infant was with her; and ſhe had kept both her Child and herſelf alive, with her Milk. They were digged up and ſaved: and ſearch was made for others. But they found no body more alive, beſides one Child, which was hanging upon the Breaſts of its Mother, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead. When they took the Dead up out of the Ruins, it was ſo lamentable a ſight, that the living had no Hearts to rejoyce ſo much as for their own ſafety; ſo great was the Calamity which then afflicted <hi>Antioch. Trajan</hi> eſcaped through a Window out of the Houſe where he was, by the help of a Man who was extraordinarily Tall, and who came and carried him off, but not without ſome ſmall Hurts. As the Earthquake continued ſeveral days, he kept himſelf all that time in the open Air, in the Cirque. The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                        <hi>Liſon</hi> was ſo ſhook, that the Top of it bowed and burſt, and threatned to fall down upon the Town. Other Mountains fell, and great Waters ſtarted up where none was before, and Streams that had flown before, forſook their Courſe and vaniſhed.</p>
                     <p>The Spring being returned, <hi>Trajan</hi> carried<note place="margin">Trajan <hi>proceeds in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</hi>

The Boats were all brought from thence to the River upon Land-Carriages; being built in that manner, that they were to be taken aſunder, and joyned again into a Bridge at Pleaſure. Which was done; and the Bridge was laid over the <hi>Tigris</hi> at the Foot of the Mountain <hi>Cardynus;</hi> not without the great annoyance of the Enemy on the other ſide, who were Poſted to oppoſe it. To give whom a Diverſion, whilſt the Bridge was fitting with all ſpeed, as <hi>Trajan</hi> had Men and Boats in plenty, he Armed out ſome Boats with Archers and other Soldiers, and detached them againſt the Barbarians. He detached others to be moving up and down, as it were to try to Land in other places, which ſo diſtracted the Barbarians, and eſpecially they were ſo ſurprized to ſee ſuch a number of Shipping gotten together in a Country that is deſtitute of Wood, that they gave way, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Army paſſed the River.</p>

Their Town is neither Great nor Rich; but the Country adjoyning to it is for the moſt part a Deſart; without Water, which it ſeldom hath, and then it is naught; without Wood, and without Forage: all which make it impoſſible for a great number of Men to lye long before it, defended as it alſo is by the heats of the Sun, to which it is expoſed. So it was neither taken by <hi>Trajan</hi> then, nor by <hi>Severus</hi> afterwards, though they both made Breaches in part of the Walls. <hi>Trajan</hi> diſguiſed himſelf, and Headed a Body of Horſe up to the Walls in Perſon; but his Horſe returned in an ill Condition to the Camp, and himſelf eſcaped very narrowly: For the Barbarians believing it was he, by his Age and Preſence, ſhot at him, and killed a Horſeman that was next him. It Thundered and Lightened, Rainbows appeared in the Clouds, Storms of Hail and Wind fell upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they made their Attacks.

                     <p>IF we take the Original of the Emperor<note place="margin">His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> 
                        <hi>Hadrian</hi> at the higheſt, it is to be derived from the Antient People of the <hi>Marca d' Ancona,</hi> and particularly from the Town of <hi>Adria</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which was the Place which his Anceſtors were of, before they removed into <hi>Spain;</hi> where, as himſelf ſays in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52508:28"/> Account which he writes of his own Life, they ſettled in <hi>Sevilla la Viegia,</hi> or <hi>Old Sevile,</hi> in the times of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s. His more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Deſcent was from that Family in <hi>Spain. Aelius Hadrian Afer</hi> was his Father, who was Couſin-German to the Emperor <hi>Trajan.</hi> His Mother was <hi>Domitia Paulina,</hi> who was Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of <hi>Cadiz.</hi> His Siſter <hi>Paulina</hi> married <hi>Servianus.</hi> His Wife was <hi>Sabina,</hi> and his great Grand-father's Grand-father, <hi>Marullinus,</hi> was the firſt of the Family who was a Senator of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> He was born at <hi>Rome</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nineth of the Calends of <hi>February,</hi> in the Year when <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were the Conſuls, which was then the Seventh time of the Conſulſhip of the firſt, and the Fifth of that of the other. In the Tenth Year of his Age, he loſt his Father, and received for his Guardians, his Kinſman, <hi>Ulpius Trajan,</hi> who had been then a <hi>Praetor,</hi> and afterwards arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be Emperor, together with <hi>Caelius Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman.</p>
                     <p>In his Fifteenth Year after having finiſhed<note place="margin">His Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> his <hi>Greek,</hi> unto which his Genius inclined him in that manner, that by ſome he was called by the Name of the <hi>Little Grecian;</hi> he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he entred immediately into the Army, and was eager of exerciſing himſelf in Hunting, almoſt to a Fault. <hi>Trajan</hi> re-called him out of that Country unto <hi>Rome</hi> again, where he lived with him as his Son; and it was not long before he was put into the Commiſſion of the <hi>Decemviri.</hi> He was removed from thence to be the <hi>Tribune</hi> or Colonel of the <hi>Second Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52508:29"/> Legion.</hi> After that, he was tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Lower Moeſia,</hi> which was about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the Reign of <hi>Domitian.</hi> In <hi>Moeſia,</hi> he was informed by an Aſtrologer of the ſame<note place="margin">Preſages concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</note> thing, as to his future Succeſſion to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which he had heard, that his great Uncle <hi>Aelius Hadrian,</hi> who alſo was skill'd in the Doctrine of Nativities, had ſometime before predicted concerning him. He was ſent out of <hi>Moeſia</hi> at the time that <hi>Trajan</hi> was adopted by <hi>Nerva,</hi> with the Congratulations of the Army to the Emperor, upon the Subject of that Adoption. <hi>Nerva</hi> tranſlated him into the <hi>Upper Germany,</hi> from whence he haſtned, upon the News of the Death of <hi>Nerva,</hi> to be the firſt who ſhould bring it unto <hi>Trajan.</hi> And<note place="margin">His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</note> altho' he was by <hi>Servianus,</hi> his Siſter's Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who had endeavoured to poſſeſs <hi>Trajan</hi> againſt him, by telling him of his Expences, and his Debts, not only a long time detain'd, but furniſhed alſo with a Carriage that broke by the way, on purpoſe to ſtop his haſte: He nevertheleſs proſecuted his Journey after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on Foot with that diligence, that he came up to <hi>Trajan</hi> before the Expreſs, which the ſame <hi>Servianus</hi> diſpatched upon the ſame occaſion.

                        </gap> that ſort of Pleaſure. And becauſe he was ſolicitous in this Conjuncture, to know what the Inclination of <hi>Trajan</hi> towards him was, as to his Adopting him to ſucceed in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52508:29"/> he conſulted his Fortune by Lots, in which he was anſwered in certain Verſes out of <hi>Virgil</hi> that favoured his deſire. Others ſay, That he received a Lot of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the Verſes of the <hi>Sibyls.</hi> But that which was a greater Preſage to him ſtill than all this, of the Empire unto which he ſhould ſucceed, was, an Anſwer which he received from an Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Nicephorus,</hi> which <hi>Apollonius Syrus</hi> the <hi>Platoniſt</hi> hath ſet down in his Works. In fine, by the interpoſition of <hi>Suras</hi> in his Favour, he eaſily attained unto a higher Degree than ever of Favour with <hi>Trajan,</hi> whoſe Niece by his Siſter's ſide, he married, which was a Match that was encouraged by <hi>Plotina,</hi> and conſented unto by <hi>Trajan,</hi> as <hi>Marius Maximus</hi> ſays, at leaſt in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>He was a Queſtor in the Year when <hi>Trajan</hi>
                        <note place="margin">He is made Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</note> and <hi>Articuleius</hi> were the Conſuls, which was then the Fourth time of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Trajan.</hi> In this Office being to recite in the Senate, an Harangue made by the Emperor to them, and being laught at for his ill pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of it, he ſet himſelf upon the Study of the <hi>Latin</hi> in that manner, that he acquired himſelf at length the greateſt Skill and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in that Language. After his Queſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he was made the Clerk to the Senate. Next he waited upon <hi>Trajan</hi> to the War againſt <hi>Dacia;</hi> at which time, how intimate he was with him, may be ſeen by this; that he ſays himſelf, <hi>That he indulged to Drinking out of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Pleaſure and Methods of</hi> Trajan,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52508:30"/> and this gained him yet greater Favours from him. He was made a <hi>Tribune of the People</hi> in<note place="margin">And Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune.</note> the Year of the Second Conſulſhips of <hi>Candidus</hi> and <hi>Quadratus.</hi> In this Magiſtracy, it was an <hi>Omen</hi> (he ſays) to him <hi>of a perpetual Tribuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Power;</hi> that is, of the Crown, that in wearing the <hi>Paenulae,</hi> (a ſort of Hanging-Coat) as the <hi>Tribunes of the People</hi> were uſed to do in time of Rain, but the Emperors of that Age never, that Garment had ſlipped off from him. In the ſecond Expedition againſt <hi>Dacia, Trajan</hi> gave him the Command of the Firſt <hi>Legion</hi> of the Name of <hi>Minervia,</hi> and took him along with him. He diſtinguiſh'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there by a great many fine Actions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that <hi>Trajan</hi> preſented him with the ſame Diamond that himſelf had been before preſented with by <hi>Nerva,</hi> which ſerved far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raiſe his Hopes. He was a <hi>Praetor</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſecond Conſulſhips of <hi>Suranus</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianus;</hi> at the ſame time he received from <hi>Trajan</hi> Forty Thouſand <hi>Seſterces</hi> towards the Charges of the publick Games, with which he treated the People. After this, being made the <hi>Pro-Praetor</hi> of the <hi>Lower Pannonia,</hi> he brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Sarmatae,</hi> diſciplined the Army, and reſtrained the Procurators of the Province from exceeding, as they did, the juſt Limits of their Power; for theſe Services he was made a Conſul. In which Magiſtracy, as ſoon as it<note place="margin">And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul.</note> was underſtood from <hi>Suras,</hi> that he was to be adopted by <hi>Trajan,</hi> he was accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by all, who deſired to preſerve the Favour of their Prince. After the Death of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52508:30"/> 
                        <hi>Suras,</hi> his Intereſt with <hi>Trajan</hi> did ſtill increaſe, becauſe he ſucceeded into the Office of <hi>Suras,</hi> to write his Prince's Speeches, and his Letters as his Secretary; beſides all which, he had the Favour of <hi>Plotina,</hi> by whoſe means he was appointed the Lieutenant of <hi>Syria,</hi> in the time of the Expedition againſt <hi>Parthia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Perſons with whom he at this time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained<note place="margin">His Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</note> a Friendſhip, were <hi>Soſſius Pappus</hi> and <hi>Pletorius Nepos,</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Senators;</hi> and <hi>Tatianus,</hi> who was before his Guardian, and <hi>Martius Livianus Turbo,</hi> of that of the Gentlemen; <hi>Palmas</hi> and <hi>Celſus</hi> had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways his Enemies. But now thoſe two being faln into Diſgrace upon a Suſpicion of a Deſign to uſurp the Empire. This facilitated the Buſineſs of <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s Adoption, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the Favour of <hi>Plotina,</hi> created a Conſul a ſecond time, he indeed conceived within himſelf entire Aſſurances of that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. It was the Opinion of many, that he had to this end corrupted alſo the Servants of <hi>Trajan,</hi> and had made very much of the <hi>Boys</hi> who were <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Paramours, and had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with Oyntments and Waſhes in the time that he was converſant about the Court. However that is, the Letters of his<note place="margin">He is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted.</note> Adoption came to him into <hi>Syria,</hi> whereof he then was <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> upon the Fifth of the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which Day he therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be celebrated for a Feſtival for the ſame. Upon the Third of the ſame <hi>Ides,</hi> he received the News of the Death of <hi>Trajan,</hi> he commanded that Day to be celebrated for the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52508:31"/> Feſtival of his acceſſion to the Empire. It had been many times before thought, that <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Deſign was to have left <hi>Neratius Priſcus,</hi> and not <hi>Hadrian</hi> his Succeſſor; becauſe many of his Friends had agreed with him in <hi>Priſcus,</hi> to whom he ſometimes alſo had ſaid publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>If I die, I recommend the Empire to you.</hi> Others ſay, That <hi>Trajan</hi> ſometime had it in his Thought to die after the Example of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> without appointing any certain Succeſſor. Again, others tell us, That it was likewiſe in his Mind to have ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Senate, to let them know, that if he died, they themſelves ſhould give a Prince to the Empire of <hi>Rome;</hi> adding, as from him, ſome Names only, out of which they were at their Liberty to chuſe the <hi>Beſt.</hi> Neither do we want thoſe who have pretended, that the Adoption of <hi>Hadrian</hi> was a Trick, wrought by the Power of <hi>Plotina,</hi> after <hi>Trajan</hi> was dead, by ſuppoſiting a Perſon to ſpeak the Thing for <hi>Trajan,</hi> in a languiſhing Voice.</p>
                     <p>However it was, <hi>Hadrian</hi> poſſeſſed himſelf<note place="margin">And poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of the Empire.</note> of the Empire, and falling in immediately with the uſual Methods of Buſineſs, he deſired to ſecure and eſtabliſh, as much as poſſible, the Peace of all Parts. In the mean time the Nations which <hi>Trajan</hi> had Conquered, had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted. The <hi>Moors</hi> were making Incurſions upon the Frontier Provinces; the <hi>Sarmatae</hi> had declared Open War, the <hi>Britains</hi> could not be contained under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, <hi>Egypt</hi> was diſturbed with Seditions, and <hi>Lycia</hi> and <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> lifted up their Heads to a Rebellion.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52508:31"/> Therefore as for all the Countries beyond the <hi>Euphrates</hi> and the <hi>Tigris, Hadrian</hi> even relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed theſe by the Example as he ſaid of <hi>Cato, who pronounced the</hi> Macedonians <hi>a Free People, becauſe they would not be kept in ſubjection.</hi> And as he had obſerved, that <hi>Parthamaſpates,</hi> the King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> of the Appointment of <hi>Trajan,</hi> was of no great Conſideration amongſt that People, he removed him from thence to be the King over ſome other Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He began his Reign in Clemency,<note place="margin">His Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</note> whereunto he ſhew'd a great Regard by this Inſtance; that having in ſome of the firſt Days of it, had Notice given him by <hi>Tatianus,</hi> by Letters, of Three Perſons, whom he adviſed him, that he ſhould put them to Death; who were, <hi>Baebius Macer,</hi> the Governour of the City, in caſe he in the leaſt oppoſed his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; <hi>Laberius Maximus,</hi> then in Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an Iſland, becauſe he was ſuſpected to aſpire at the Empire, and <hi>Frugi Craſſus;</hi> yet nevertheleſs, he ſpared them all Three: For altho' the Governour of the Iſland where <hi>Craſſus</hi> was, did execute him for an Eſcape which he would have made, with a Deſign of fomenting New Diſorders, yet was that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution a thing that was done without <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian's</hi> Command. He doubled the uſual Donative to the Soldiers, for a good Preſage, to welcome in his Reign. He took away the Government of <hi>Mauritania</hi> from <hi>Luſius Quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

Then receiving Advice of an Inſurrection of the <hi>Sarmatae,</hi> and the <hi>Roxolani,</hi> he commanded his Troops into <hi>Moeſia,</hi> and went thither in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon after them. He preferred <hi>Martius Turbo,</hi> after he had adminiſtred the Government of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> to the Preſidentſhip of <hi>Pannonia</hi> and <hi>Dacia.</hi> As to the Affair of the <hi>Roxolani,</hi> he compoſed that by a Treaty, and a Peace was eſtabliſhed betwixt them and <hi>Hadrian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had ſometime deſigned to appoint <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinus</hi> to be his Succeſſor in the Empire; but <hi>Nigrinus</hi> became guilty of a Conſpiracy againſt<note place="margin">A Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</note> the Life of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> which was to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as <hi>Hadrian</hi> aſſiſted at the Sacrifices: <hi>Luſius</hi> and many others were in the ſame Plot with him, which <hi>Hadrian</hi> eſcaping, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Palmas</hi> at <hi>Terracina, Celſus</hi> at <hi>Baiae, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinus</hi> at <hi>Faenza, Luſius</hi> upon the Road, by the Order of the Senate, were all killed. And becauſe theſe Executions might be a means of creating an ill Opinion of him in the Minds of the People, as if it had been, tho' really it was not, as he ſays, by his Will, but by the Will of the Senate, that Four Perſons, all of Conſular Dignity, were ſacrificed ſo all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Hadrian</hi> came preſently to <hi>Rome,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>Dacia</hi> unto the Government of <hi>Turbo,</hi> whom to add to his Authority, he had likewiſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52508:33"/> honoured with the Title of the <hi>Praefecture</hi> of <hi>Egypt:</hi> And at <hi>Rome</hi> he careſſed the People to ſtifle the Apprehenſions which were there of him, with a double Largeſs upon his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,<note place="margin">His Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> which was over and above a Bounty of three Pieces of Gold a head, which had been divided amongſt them, in his abſence before. He acquitted himſelf before all the Senate of the Fact that had paſſed; and as for his own part, he took his Oath, that he would never puniſh a Senator, otherwiſe than according to the very Sentence of the Senate. He proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eaſe the particular Towns and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the Charge of the <hi>publick Poſt</hi> and Carriages, by ordering them to be maintained out of the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> in fine, to omit nothing to make himſelf to be eſteemed, he forgave an infinite number of Debts, which were due to the <hi>Exchequer</hi> from private Perſons in the City, and all over the Country; as alſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Arrears of great Sums which were due from the Provinces; the Bonds and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters relating whereunto were all burnt in the <hi>Forum</hi> of <hi>Trajan,</hi> for a full Security to every one againſt thoſe Claims. He ſuffered it not, that the Eſtates of Perſons condemned, ſhould be confiſcated into his private Coffers, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them all to be return'd into the publick Treaſury. And as <hi>Trajan</hi> had begun to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Support of the poor Infants of both Sexes, who were not by the Law to be admitted to the general Dole before ſuch an Age, ſo <hi>Hadrian</hi> enlarged that Munificence, and made an Addition to their Penſion. Unto
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52508:33"/> ſuch of the Senators as were reduc'd, but had not conſumed their Fortunes by their ill Lives and Debauchery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſet out Penſions ſuitable to their Quality, and ſuitable to the Number of the Children which they had; continuing the ſame to many to their Deaths. It was not only to his Favourites to whom he exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Bounty, but to others he generouſly gave great Things, to enable them to acquit themſelves in their Offices with Honour. To ſome neceſſitous Women he allowed Penſions towards their Maintenance. The Games of the <hi>Gladiators</hi> were exhibited Six Days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a Thouſand wild Beaſts at his Charge were expoſed to be hunted and taken upon the Anniverſary of his Birth.</p>
                     <p>He choſe himſelf out of the principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons<note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of the Senate, an Imperial Council. He refuſed to accept of any other of the Games of the <hi>Cirque,</hi> which were decreed in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, than ſuch as thoſe which were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated upon his Birth-Day. He ſaid many times, both in his Diſcourſe, and to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, <hi>That his Government ſhould be ſuch, that the World ſhould ſee, it was the Intereſt of the People which he minded, and not his own.</hi> As he was three times Conſul himſelf, ſo he advanced ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Thrice to that Dignity: And for the Honor of a Second Conſulſhip, he beſtowed that upon a multitude of Perſons. The Third time that himſelf was Conſul, he officiated it no longer than Four Months; but yet he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſat in Perſon in Judgment. He never was abſent from the Senate, when he was either
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52508:34"/> in Town, or nigh the Town upon the Solemn Days of meeting. He carried the Honour of<note place="margin">His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for, the Senate.</note> the Senate ſo high, and made ſuch a Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of creating Senators, that when he created <hi>Tatianus,</hi> who was a Captain of the Guards, and had had all the Ornaments given him of a Conſul; he told him, <hi>That he had nothing in his Power to confer upon him, that was a greater Honour.</hi> He did not give leave to thoſe of the Order of the Knights and Gentlemen, to ſit in Judgment either without, or with him, in a Cauſe which concerned the Life of a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; altho' until then, it had been the Cuſtom, that when the Emperor takes the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of a Cauſe in Perſon, he call'd not only the Senators, but the <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen unto his Aſſiſtance, and pronounced Sentence according to the Opinions of all together. In fine, he proceeded even to execrate thoſe Princes who had had a leſſer Conſideration for the Senators than they ought. He retained ſo great a reſpect for <hi>Servianus,</hi> his Siſter's Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who had been Twice Conſul before him, that he always went out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to meet him coming; and he created him a Conſul the Third time, without his ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it; the Honour whereof was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in nothing but this, that he did not take him to be his own Colleague in that Third Conſulſhip.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, this is yet to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred<note place="margin">His Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> of this Prince, that he abandoned a great many Provinces which had been by <hi>Trajan</hi> acquired to the Empire; and the Theatre
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52508:34"/> which had been built by <hi>Trajan</hi> in the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> he deſtroyed, contrary to the deſires of all the World. And certainly theſe things ſeemed to be ſo much the worſe, as he knew very well himſelf that they were diſpleaſing, and yet he pretended that in doing them, he accompliſhed the Orders which had been left him by <hi>Trajan.</hi> He was willing when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came weary of the Power of <hi>Tatianus,</hi> the Captain of the Guards, who had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Tutor, to have had him murdered; but that which call'd him off from thoſe Thoughts, was, he had already a great deal of ill will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, upon the occaſion of the Murder of thoſe Four Conſular Perſons before-mentioned, the <hi>Odium</hi> whereof he endeavoured to throw upon <hi>Tatianus.</hi> At length <hi>Tatianus,</hi> of his own accord laid down his Commiſſion, which <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> conferred upon <hi>Turbo. Similes</hi> the other Captain of the Guards, laid down his, which <hi>Hadrian</hi> conferred upon <hi>Septimius Clarus.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs thoſe two, <hi>Tatianus</hi> and <hi>Similes,</hi> were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who very well might have deſerved his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Favour. After this, he went a Progreſs into<note place="margin">His Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance.</note> 
                        <hi>Campania,</hi> where he endeavoured to oblige all Places into which he came, with the Kindneſſes he did them, and the Largeſſes which he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them; admitting every where the Gentlemen of Eſtates and Quality to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Friendſhip. At <hi>Rome</hi> he repair'd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Perſon into the Courts of the Praetors and the Conſuls. He honoured his Miniſters with his Company at their Houſes. When they were Sick, he viſited them Twice or Thrice a Day.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52508:35"/> He viſited ſome, when Sick, who were no more than Servants that he had manumit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Comforting them in their Infirmities, and Aſſiſting them with his Counſels. He received his Friends to his Table, and was as Eaſy always with them, as if he was a private Man. The Honours which he beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Mother-in-Law at her Death, were the greateſt that were poſſible, in the Games of the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> which he exhibited, and in all other Rites, whereby he ſhewed his Duty to her.</p>
                     <p>Then he went into <hi>Gallia,</hi> where he ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized<note place="margin">
                           <hi>He goes into</hi> Gaul <hi>and</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</note> himſelf by his great Bounties, and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to Relieve all Perſons that were in Neceſſity and Want. From thence he went into <hi>Germany,</hi> and tho' he was one who was a greater Lover of Peace than War, yet here he Exerciſed the Soldiers, as if he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately making ready for a War. He incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them the Precepts of Patience, to<note place="margin">His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor towards the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery.</note> teach them to be hardy, and to be able to ſuffer. He gave them in himſelf a Model of the Life of a Soldier, viſited them in their Tents; Eat and Drank in Publick of the ſame Proviſion as they did, that is, <hi>Bacon, Cheeſe, and ſower Wine mixt with Water,</hi> after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Scipio Aemilianus, Metellus,</hi> and his Father <hi>Trajan.</hi> Were his Commands harder upon them than ordinary, he gave them Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or preferred them for their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He revived as much as it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the antient Military Diſcipline, which through the Negligence of many Princes his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52508:35"/> Predeceſſors, had been going to decay ever ſince the time of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> He ſettled the Order of the Offices, and the Expences of the Army. He ſuffered no one to be abſent from the Camp without a juſt Cauſe. The <hi>Tribunes</hi> of his Creation were ſuch, as whoſe Merits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended them to him, and not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Soldiers. He excited all to do their Duty by the Example that he ſet in himſelf. He walked Twenty Miles together on Foot at the Head of them in his Arms. He put down the uſe of Arbors, ſhady Walks, Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's, and Bowers in the Camp. He was dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many times in a very ordinary Coat, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing of Gold to his Belt, without Jewels to his Cloaths or Buckles, and the Hilt of his Sword ſcarce of Ivory. He viſited the Soldiers when they were Sick in their little Huts. He mark'd out the Camps. He made none a Centurion, who was not a ſtrong Man, and of good Repute: Nor a Tribune, unleſs he was of ſuch an Age, as by his Prudence and his Experience to be fit to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Weight of that Command. Neither did he permit the Tribunes to make the leaſt unlawful Gain of the Soldiers; nor any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſerve themſelves of nice and delicate Things, which were therefore wholly caſhiered the Camp. He examined their Arms and their Equipages whether Clean and Neat, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them as he ſaw Occaſion. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what Age every one was of, becauſe he would have none to ſerve in the Field con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the antient Cuſtom, who was either
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52508:36"/> too young to be of a proper Strength to bear Arms, or too old and paſt it. He took Care that his Soldiers were perſonally always known to him, and he kept an Account how many of them preciſely they were.</p>
                     <p>He gave himſelf the Trouble to examine into the State of the Magazines of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Proviſions; and whether the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of the Provinces were well paid, and into the State of the Provinces, that if any thing was amiſs any where, he might ſupply the Defect. Particularly, he deſired to cut off all ſuperfluous Expences, and that his Officers ſhould lay out their Money upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was of no uſe. So having model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Army to his own Pleaſure, he next ſet upon an Expedition into <hi>Great Britain,</hi> where as he corrected a great many Defaults, ſo he was the firſt who made a Wall there, that was<note place="margin">
                           <hi>His Wall in</hi> Britain.</note> Fourſcore Miles in Length, to ſerve for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion betwixt the <hi>Barbarians</hi> and the <hi>Romans. Septimius Clarus,</hi> a Captain of the Guards, and <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus,</hi> Secretary of the Diſpatches, with others, having converſed without his Leave, a little more familiarly with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Sabina,</hi> than was well conſiſtent with the Honour of the Court, he turned them out, and put others into their places. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>he would,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>have diſcharged his very Empreſs, as one that he conceived diſagreable and ill humored, had be been but as a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> He was not only inquiſitive into all that<note place="margin">His Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</note> paſſed in his own Houſhold, but likewiſe into the Houſes of his Neighbours; inſomuch, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52508:36"/> by his Spies, he was told of all the ſecret Actions done amongſt them, whilſt they in the mean time never ſuſpected it, nor knew any thing of it, until himſelf diſcovered it. Upon which occaſion, it will not be unpleaſant to inſert a Paſſage wherein we may certainly ſee what a Knowledge he had of a great many things as to his Neighbours. A Perſon had received a Letter from his Wife, in which ſhe told him, <hi>That he was ſo taken up with his Pleaſures and the Baths, that he made no Thoughts of returning again to her Arms. Hadrian</hi> was informed of this by his Spies; ſo when that Perſon came to him to deſire the leave of him to retire Home, <hi>Hadrian</hi> gave him a gentle <hi>Rub</hi> of his Baths and his Pleaſures. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays the Gentleman, <hi>Hath my Wife written the ſame to your Majeſty, that ſhe hath written to me?</hi> Indeed this Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiveneſs was thought to be a very great Fault in <hi>Hadrian;</hi> all the <hi>Amours</hi> of the <hi>Sparks,</hi> and the Secret Adulteries of the married La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he took the Pains to pry into; but which was worſe, he did not keep the Counſel when he had done, of his greateſt Friends.</p>
                     <p>After having ſettled the Affairs of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> he croſſed over into <hi>Gallia,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Advice of a Sedition in <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ariſen about their God <hi>Apis;</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been brought to Light anew, after many Years that he had been loſt, the Diſpute in what City he ought to be plac'd, created ſtrange Diſorders amongſt the People, becauſe all of them earneſtly contended to have him. At <hi>Niſmes</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he built a Temple to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52508:37"/> Honour of <hi>Plotina,</hi> which was an admirable Work. Then he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and paſſed<note place="margin">
                           <hi>He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives in</hi> Spain.</note> the Winter at <hi>Tarragona,</hi> where at his proper Charge he re-edified the Temple of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> and having Aſſembled all the States of <hi>Spain</hi> together at <hi>Tarragona,</hi> he conſulted with them with great Prudence and Dexterity in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, conſidering their Diviſions about the raiſing of Levies amongſt them. At <hi>Tarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona</hi> he eſcaped a very great Danger, and in a manner, which was not inglorious. As he was walking in a Garden, a Servant belonging to the Maſter of the Houſe where he was, ran upon him furiouſly with a drawn Sword, to kill him, <hi>Hadrian</hi> cloſed with the Man, and took him Priſoner and delivered him to the Cuſtody of the Guards, who were flocking in to his Aſſiſtance. But when it was plainly ſeen that the Man was Mad, he ſent him to the Phyſicians to be cured, and took no more Notice of the Matter. In many Places where the <hi>Barbarians</hi> are not ſeparated from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> by Rivers, but only by Land-marks, he made Walls of Earth, ſupported by Stakes, and ſtrengthened with Palliſadoes for a Partition betwixt them. He appointed a King over the <hi>Germans;</hi> he ſuppreſſed the Commotions of the <hi>Moors,</hi> ſo that he merited the Honour from the Senate to have Sacrifices and Solemn Prayers offered for him. The <hi>Parthians</hi> did but make a meen or ſingle Motion towards a War, but it was compoſed again by one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Hadrian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:52508:37"/>
                     <p>After this he came by Sea along the Coaſt<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Voyages,</hi> &amp;c.</note> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Iſlands, unto the Province of <hi>Achaia,</hi> where he was initiated in the <hi>Eleuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Rites, after the Examples of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and King <hi>Philip.</hi> He was very generous to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and preſided at their Games. He ſailed from thence to <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he had the Curioſity to viſit the top of the Mountain <hi>Aetna,</hi> from thence to view the Riſing Sun; how various they ſay, it appears there in its Colours, in the Nature of thoſe of the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow. From <hi>Sicily</hi> he came home to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from <hi>Rome</hi> he croſſed the Sea again into <hi>Africa,</hi> leaving many Marks of his Liberality upon the Provinces of that Country; ſo that one may ſay, that ſcarce never hath there been a Prince known to Travel over ſo much Land, and with ſo much diſpatch as he. He had no ſooner returned back to <hi>Rome</hi> out of <hi>Africa,</hi> but he ſet upon a New Voyage into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and took his way through <hi>Athens.</hi> The Works which he had begun at <hi>Athens,</hi> he now finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dedicated; amongſt the reſt, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Altar of <hi>Jupiter Olympius.</hi> In <hi>Aſia,</hi> as he travelled, he likewiſe Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Temples there, which abide as ſo many Memorials of his Name. Whilſt he was in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> he admitted a Number of the People of that Country into the Service of his Army. He invited the Princes and the Kings of the Dominions where he came, to joyn in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him. Particularly he invited to his Friendſhip <hi>Choſroes</hi> the King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> to whom he returned his Daughter that <hi>Trajan</hi>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52508:38"/> had formerly taken Captive, promiſing the ſame as to a Chair of State, which had been then likewiſe taken and carried away in that War. He received thoſe Kings when they came, ſo generouſly, and treated them in that manner, that others who ſtaid away upon the Account, eſpecially of <hi>Phariſmanes,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently ſlighted him, might have an occaſion to repent themſelves. As he traverſed the Provinces, he puniſhed ſome Procurators, and ſome Preſidents of them for their Malverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo ſeverely, that they ſaid, he had a mind certainly to encourage Accuſers to appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                     <p>He had a great Diſpleaſure againſt the People of <hi>Antioch,</hi> wherefore it was in his Thoughts to ſeparate <hi>Syria</hi> from <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> that <hi>Antioch</hi> ſhould not be ſaid to be the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of ſo many Cities. The <hi>Jews</hi> about this time broke into a War, becauſe they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to Circumciſe themſelves. He went upon the Mountain <hi>Liſon,</hi> which is near <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> in the Night, for the Curioſity of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from thence the Riſing-Sun. <hi>Jupiter</hi> was worſhipped upon that Mountain, to whom, as <hi>Hadrian</hi> was Sacrificing there, a violent Storm aroſe with Thunder and Lightning, which blaſted both the Victim and the Prieſt. He traverſed <hi>Arabia,</hi> and came to the City of <hi>Peluſium</hi> or <hi>Belvais</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Tomb of <hi>Pompey</hi> which is at this City being decayed, he rebuilt it with greater Magnificence.</p>
                     <p>As he was ſailing upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> his dear <hi>Antinous</hi> died, for whom he wept with all the

Some ſay that he devoted himſelf a Sacrifice for <hi>Hadrian.</hi> Others, that he was what his Beauty might probably incite him to be, and the too great Pleaſure which <hi>Hadrian</hi> took in a Burdaſh However it was, the <hi>Grecians,</hi> at the deſire of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> made a God of him; and we are told of Oracles which have been uttered by him; but they are rather ſome ſuppoſed Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Hadrian;</hi> who was excellent at Verſe, and indeed at all ſorts of the <hi>Belles Lettres.</hi> For he had a great Hand at Arithmetick, Geometry, and Painting. He underſtood Muſick, and played perfectly well upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtruments, and Sung. Loving his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſo exceſſively, as he did, he could not but Compoſe many Poems of his Amours. Together with which he was a Maſter in the matter of Arms; had the Military Art in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and was skilled at the Weapons of the Gladiatours. He was a Perſon equally Severe and Pleaſant, Affable and Grave; Active and Conſiderate, Cloſe and Liberal, Cruel and Merciful, in all things ever various.</p>
                     <p>He enriched his Friends, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ask him any favour; and to others upon their asking he denyed nothing. But yet he was eaſie to give ear to every Tale which was but whiſpered concerning them. And this was the occaſion, that almoſt all thoſe whom either he had dearly loved, or whom he had raiſed to the higheſt Honours,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52508:39"/> were afterwards treated by him as Enemies;<note place="margin">His Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Injuſtice.</note> as was <hi>Tatianus, Nepos,</hi> and <hi>Septimius Clarus.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Eudaemon,</hi> who had once been Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to all his Counſels, and his Confident in the very Affair of his aſpiring to the Empire, was reduced by him to extreme Beggery. He conſtrained <hi>Polyaenus</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves. He made the moſt notorious defamatory Libels upon <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Tatianus,</hi> under a pretence of his being in a Conſpiracy againſt him, to be Arraigned and Proſcribed. He perſecuted <hi>Numidius Quadratus, Catilius Severus,</hi> and <hi>Turbo,</hi> very grievouſly. He put to death <hi>Servianus,</hi> his Siſters Husband, when he was in his Nineti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Year, only becauſe he would be ſure, that he ſhould not out-live him. In fine, he Perſecuted without remiſſion both his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and his Soldiers. As ready as he was at his Compoſitions, always in Proſe and Verſe, and skilled in all the Liberal Arts; he yet laught at the Publick Profeſſors of the Arts, and triumphed over them; entered many times into Solemn Diſputes with all of them together, and with all the Philoſophers; only for the Glory of Compoſing better Books, or better Verſes than they. He excepted once particularly againſt a Word, which was uſed by <hi>Favori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> who modeſtly ſubmitting himſelf to him in it; but being blamed by his Friends for yielding the Cauſe ſo in a Word for which there was ſufficient Authority to be produced out of good Authors; <hi>Favorinus</hi> made a very pleaſant Jeſt upon it. Says he, <hi>My Friends,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52508:39"/> you are much miſtaken, if you do not allow me to believe him to be a Learneder Man than us all, who is the Maſter of Thirty Legions.</hi>

                     <p>So fond was he of his Glory, as to this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that he writ his own Life, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave it to his Servants (that were Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) to publiſh it only under their Names: Thus the Books under the name of <hi>Phlegon,</hi> are <hi>Hadrians.</hi> The <hi>Catachriani</hi> are his, which are extremely obſcure pieces, in imitation of <hi>Antimachus.</hi> The Poet <hi>Florus,</hi> having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to him, thus, as follows;</p>

                     <p>He took more delight in the Antient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings<note place="margin">His Learning.</note> than the Modern, and was pleaſed with making Declamations.

But although he gave himſelf the liberty, as hath been ſaid, to reprehend the Muſicians, Tragedians, Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Grammarians, Rhetoricians, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and Oratours, and to teize them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually with Queſtions, yet he preſerved a real kindneſs for them, and honoured them with the marks of his eſteem: If he had been the occaſion, that many times they went diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from him, he ſaid, <hi>He however took it ill, if he ſaw any body do ſo.</hi> He was more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly familiar with the Philoſophers <hi>Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Heliodorus, Phavorinus,</hi> was much in his favour. And when theſe Doctors became by Age unfit any longer for their Profeſſions, he took care of them, and diſmiſt them from their Labours, with marks of Honour.</p>
                     <p>The Enemies which he had in his Private<note place="margin">

To one of them, his Expreſſion was, after he was Emperor, <hi>It is well, you have Eſcaped me.</hi> He gave always Horſes, Mules, Cloaths, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52508:40"/> and all their Equipages to his Officers that he ſent into the Provinces. He often ſent his Miniſters upon the Feaſts of <hi>Saturn</hi> Preſents, and accepted of others from them again. When he made a Royal Banquent for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of a great number of Perſons of the Court and the City, he hath ordered Diſhes to be brought up to him from the lowermoſt Tables, to ſee whether they were well uſed there by the Servants of his Houſhold. His Preſents which he ſent at any time to Princes, always exceeded thoſe which they ſent to him: He frequently Bathed in Publick, and in the Company of all the World without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which gave an occaſion to a pleaſant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which was this. There was a <hi>Veteran</hi> Soldier at the Bath, whom he had known in the War, ſcrubbing his Back and his Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wall in a Corner, by himſelf. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> ſeeing him, asked him <hi>what was his fancy to rub himſelf ſo againſt the Walls?</hi> The Man ſaid, <hi>It was, Becauſe he had never a Servant to rub him.</hi> Immediately <hi>Hadrian</hi> ſent him one, and withal gave him an Eſtate to keep one. Another day, ſeveral other Old Men, in the like manner, were rubbing themſelves againſt the Wall, in hopes to provoke <hi>Hadrian</hi> to be as bountiful to them. But inſtead of that he ordered them to be called out, and to take their turns to rub down one another. He was a lover of the Common People, and took a glory in ſhewing it. Fond of Travelling, and whatever he had read in Books concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part of the Earth, he was willing to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52508:41"/> learn the truth of it upon the Place. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Cold and the Weather ſo hardily, that he never went with his Head covered. To ſeveral Kings of the Countries where he came, he paid a great deal of reſpect. The moſt part of whom entred into Leagues of Friendſhip with him; ſome indeed ſlighted him. And to many he made great Preſents, but no one Perſon greater than he did to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmanes</hi> the King of <hi>Iberia;</hi> to whom, beſides other things which were Magnificent, he ſent fifty Elephants. The Preſents in return, which that King ſent to him, were alſo great. But among the reſt he had ſent Tunicks Embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Gold: in deriſion of which, <hi>Hadrian</hi> ordered Three hundred Malefactours to be dreſſed in the like Tunicks embroydered in Gold, wherein to fight upon the publick Stage the Prizes of the Gladiatours.</p>
                     <p>When he ſate upon Judgment in Perſon, he took to his aſſiſtance not only his Courtiers and Friends, but the profeſſed Lawyers; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Juventius Celſus, Salvius Julianus, Nera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Priſcus,</hi> and others, who were Men Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally approved by the Senate. He ordered amongſt other things, that no Houſes in any City ſhould in any wiſe be taken down, for the ſake of rebuilding them in another, or transferring the Materials to another. He granted unto the Children of Perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, the twelfth part of the Eſtates of their Fathers. He admitted of no informations of High Treaſon. He refuſed to ſtand Heir to ſuch as he did not know; neither would he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52508:41"/> accept the Inheritances of thoſe he did, in caſe they had Children of their own to enjoy them. Concerning <hi>Treaſure-Trouve,</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was; that if the Party had found it in his own Ground, he ſhould take it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; if he found it in anothers, he ſhould give a Moiety of it to the Proprietor of that Ground; if he found it upon the publick Ground, he ſhould ſhare it equally with the Exchequer. He made it unlawful for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters<note place="margin">Some of his Laws.</note> to put their Slaves to death; and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Slaves ſhould be Tried and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the publick Judges as they deſerved it. His Law againſt ſuch as had conſumed their Eſtates, was, that if they were under their own Authority, they ſhould be expoſed to a publick Shame in the Amphitheatre, and then turned out of the Town. He took away the Private Priſons, for Servants and Slaves, which had uſed to be before in the Hands of their Maſters. He ſeparated the Baths for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct uſe of either Sex. If a Maſter was found kill'd in his Houſe, he ordered that not all the Slaves ſhould be put to the Queſtion about the Murder, but thoſe only who were near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have perceived and prevented it.</p>
                     <p>The Country of <hi>Hetruria</hi> nominated him to be their Praetor, and he was ſo, when he was Emperour. In like manner he was the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator, the <hi>Aedilis,</hi> and the <hi>Duumvir,</hi> that is, the Chief Magiſtrate ſo called, of ſeveral Towns in <hi>Latium.</hi> The City of <hi>Naples</hi> choſe him to be their <hi>Demarchus.</hi> The City of <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that of <hi>Adria</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52508:42"/> were the two Places of the Deſcent of him and his Anceſtours, choſe him to be their <hi>Quinquennalis.</hi> At <hi>Athens</hi> he was the <hi>Archon.</hi> In almoſt all the Cities where he came he Built, and gave publick Sports to the People. At <hi>Athens</hi> he exhibited a Chaſe in the <hi>Stadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> of above a Thouſand Wild Beaſts. He never ſerved himſelf upon theſe occaſions of any Huntſmen, or Players from the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> At <hi>Rome</hi> the Pleaſures of the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, which he Celebrated to the Honour of his Mother-in-Law were infinite. Amongſt the reſt he made the People a Largeſs of Aromatick Sacrifices: and upon the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals to the honour of <hi>Trajan</hi> he commanded the ſeveral Seats of the Theatre to be perfumed with Balm and Saffron. He had Plays of all ſorts acted in the Theatre, as antiently. He permitted the Comedians of the Court to Act in the Plays which were given by private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. He exhibited in the <hi>Cirque</hi> many wild Beaſts, and many times a hundred Lions to be killed at a time. He often treated the People with Anticks and Maſquerades. He often went to ſee the Combats of the Gladiators. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the infinite number of Works which he built in ſeveral places, he never cauſed his own Name to be Engraved upon any of them, but upon the Temple of <hi>Trajan.</hi> He re-edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> together with the <hi>Septa,</hi> the Temple of <hi>Neptune,</hi> a great many Religious Houſes, the <hi>Forum</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the Bagnio of <hi>Agrippa:</hi> all which he Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated anew, but ſtill under their Proper, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52508:42"/> their Antient Names. He built a Bridge over th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Tiber,</hi> which he called by his own name, together with a Sepulchre for himſelf near the <hi>Tiber.</hi> He tranſlated the Temple of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Cybele</hi> from the place where it was to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He did the ſame to a <hi>Coloſſus</hi> which ſtood there, where now is the Temple of the City. This was a great and a laborious Task. It was removed in the Poſture in which it was ſtanding; being raiſed by the Architect <hi>Daetrianus;</hi> four and twenty Elephants were Employed upon it. After he had Re-conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated this vaſt Coloſs to the Sun, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was Conſecrated to <hi>Nero,</hi> whoſe Head was to it, he propoſed to build ſuch another Monument to the honour of the Moon, by the Hand of the Architect <hi>Apollodorus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was moſt extremely Affable and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in his Diſcourſes which he had with Perſons of low degree; and he hated ſuch as ſhould Envy him a Pleaſure which was ſo ſenſible to him, upon the pretence of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Gravity and Port of a Prince. At <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the Academy, he both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſeveral Queſtions to be anſwered by the Profeſſors, and anſwered others which they propoſed to him. <hi>Marius Maximus</hi> ſays, that he was in his own Nature Cruel; but yet that he did many Pious and obliging things: the reaſon whereof was his fear, that he might otherwiſe have the ſame Fortune with that which befel <hi>Domitian.</hi> Although he did not love Titles and Inſcriptions upon his Works, he however called ſeveral Cities, even <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52508:43"/> it ſelf, and a part of <hi>Athens,</hi> together with a multitude of Aqueducts, after his own name. He was the firſt who Created the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer called <hi>Advocatus Fiſci,</hi> that is, Advocate of the Exchequer. He had a happy Memory,<note place="margin">His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Wit.</note> and admirable Parts. He dictated all his own Speeches, and anſwered to every thing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. There are ſeveral of his Jeſts; being a very pleaſant Man in Converſation. Amongſt the reſt, this is one: an old Man in Gray Hairs having asked him ſomething, which he denyed him, and coming to ask it again, but with his Hair tinged firſt unto a youthful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; ſays he to him, <hi>I have already denyed this thing to your Father.</hi> He remembred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by their Names ſo very well, without the help of a Prompter, that though he had heard them but once, he preſently corrected any one that miſtook them. He remembred even the Names of all the old Soldiers, whom he had disbanded. The Books which he read, though they were out of the common way, and difficult, he would repeat to you again al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely by heart. At one and the ſame time, he Writ, Dictated, hearken'd to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and diſcourſed himſelf with his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. He retained in his mind all the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs ſo well, that no diligent Maſter of a Family, better knows thoſe of his own Houſe. He loved his Horſes and Dogs to that degree, that he built them Tombs, and writ them Epitaphs. He built a Town, which he ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He made an exact enquiry always into all things acted by the Preſidents of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, until he was ſatisfied in the Truth. He ſuffered not his Servants, whom he had Manumitted, to Influence him, nor to be thought to do ſo. He ſaid, that it was the eaſineſs of the Princes his Predeceſſours, which had been the occaſion always of the Vices of thoſe Men. Therefore if any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have gained an Intereſt in him, he preſently puniſhed them. We have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Nature, in what he did particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to one of them, whom he ſaw out of a Window walking in the midſt betwixt two Senatours. It is ſevere, and yet it comes ſomething near to a piece of Raillery. He ſent one to him, to give him a Box on the Ear, and to tell him; <hi>That it was not for him to walk betwixt two Senatours, to whom he might ſtill be reduced to be a Slave.</hi> Of all Diſhes of Meat, his fancy was eſpecially for an Oglio of Pheaſants, Brawn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In his time a Famine, a Plague, and an Earthquake happen'd. For all which he expiated the Gods by Sacrifices as much as it was poſſible; and generouſly ſuccoured the People and the Cities, that were laid waſt by them: There was alſo an Inundation of the <hi>Tiber.</hi> He made ſeveral Cities free of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to others he remitted their Tribute. No great Expeditions happened under his Reign. His Wars paſſed over almoſt in ſilence. He was beloved by the Soldiers; becauſe he took
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52508:44"/> always a great Care of them, and was very bountiful to them. The <hi>Parthians</hi> were his ſtedfaſt Friends, becauſe he delivered them from the Yoke which <hi>Trajan</hi> had impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. He permitted the <hi>Armenians</hi> to have a King of their own; whereas under <hi>Trajan</hi> they received a <hi>Roman</hi> Lieutenant. He did not exact of the <hi>Meſopotamians</hi> the Tribute which was impoſed upon them by <hi>Trajan.</hi> The Countries of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Iberia</hi> were very affectionate to him: The Kings of the <hi>Bactri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſent their Ambaſſadors to him, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſired his Friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>He oftentimes himſelf appointed the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons<note place="margin">His Care of the Publick.</note> who ſhould be the Guardians to <hi>minors.</hi> He took Care of the publick Manners, no leſs than he did of the Diſcipline of the Army. He commanded the Senators and the <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen to appear always in Publick in Gowns. Accordingly himſelf, when in <hi>Italy,</hi> went always in a Gown. He received the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators ſtanding, when they came to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him at his Banquets. He ſettled, with the help of the Magiſtrates for that purpoſe, the Expences, beyond which no one ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their Feaſts; which he reformed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the antient <hi>Julian</hi> Law. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the Citizens to appear attended with ſo much heavy Equipages as they did, coming out of the Country. He ſuffered not the Baths to be opened before Two a Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, unleſs it was for the Sick. He was the firſt of the Emperors who took of the Knights and Gentlemen to ſerve him as his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52508:44"/> Secretaries. He had a Compaſſion for ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them as were poor, and he knew were of an innocent Life; as much as on the other hand, he hated a Man who was grown Rich by Craft. He took great Care to obſerve the Holy Rites of the Religion of the <hi>Romans:</hi> But as for others which were of Foreign Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, he ſlighted them. He officiated in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as High Prieſt. He many times had Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes tried before him at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; admitting the Conſuls, the Praetors, and ſome of the beſt Heads of the Senate to his aſſiſtance, as his Council. He cleanſed the Lake <hi>Fucinus.</hi> He appointed Four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſuls for the Adminiſtration of Juſtice throughout all <hi>Italy.</hi> At his coming into <hi>Africa</hi> it rained, which it not having done in that Country before in five Years; this was an occaſion that he was very dear to that People.</p>
                     <p>Going always in his Travels in all Parts, with his Head uncovered, and many times in the greateſt Showrs, and the greateſt Colds, at laſt he fell into a Sickneſs, which obliged<note place="margin">He ſickens</note> him to take to his Bed; and being ſolicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Perſon whom he ſhould make a Choice of for his Succeſſour, his firſt Thoughts carried him upon <hi>Servianus;</hi> but upon a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſideration, as hath been ſaid, he put him to Death, together with <hi>Fuſcus,</hi> whom he hated upon the account of certain Preſages and Prodigies which had happened, and which might give <hi>Fuſcus</hi> the Encouragement to dare to hope for the Empire. The like jealouſie
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52508:45"/> which he was inclined to have of <hi>Pletorius Nepos,</hi> made him, that now he hated him, as much as before he had loved him. Thus he hated alſo <hi>Terentius Gentianus,</hi> and ſo much the more, as he knew, that he was beloved by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. In ſhort, he had an averſion to every one,<note place="margin">His Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie.</note> upon whom he look'd with an Eye of jealouſie, as if they aſpired to the Empire in his place. But ſtill he however ſtifled all the Motions of that Cruelty which was in his Heart, till ſuch time as he was brought almoſt to his laſt, of a Flux of Blood at <hi>Tivoli;</hi> and then he ordered <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianus</hi> directly to be put to Death, pretending he was one who had affected the Empire, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving treated the Servants of the Court with Suppers, and ſat himſelf down in the Chair which is for the Emperor, and courted the Favour of the Soldiers. Several others at the ſame time by his Order, either publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate were put to Death; which is the leſs to be admired, becauſe <hi>Sabina,</hi> his own Conſort, died ſuddenly after, not without a Suſpicion of her being Poyſoned by him. In the next place, he took up a Reſolution to adopt <hi>Cejo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

So he accordingly did it, and called him by the Name and Title of <hi>Aelius Verus Caeſar,</hi> how diſpleaſing ſoever this was to others. To honour whoſe Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he gave the Games of the <hi>Cirque</hi> to the People, and beſtowed upon both the People and the Soldiers a Free Bounty. He made him a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,

And indeed <hi>Commodus</hi> was ſo ill, he was not able ſo much as to go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn his Thanks to <hi>Hadrian</hi> in the Senate, for the Honour which he had done him. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken at laſt a Doſe which happened to be<note place="margin">Who dies.</note> too ſtrong for him, his Illneſs redoubled, and he fell into a Sleep, in which he died, the firſt Day of <hi>January;</hi> which being a ſolemn Day for Congratulating the Emperor upon the New Year, and of making Oblations to the Gods, there was an Order from <hi>Hadrian</hi> to put off the Mourning on that Day for his Death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aelius Verus Caeſar</hi> being dead, and <hi>Hadrian</hi> finding himſelf ſtill worſe, as to his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>He adopts</hi> Antoninus</note> he adopted next <hi>Arrius Antoninus,</hi> who was afterwards called <hi>Antoninus the Pious;</hi> that is, he adopted him upon this Condition, that <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſhould adopt two others, who were <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antoninus:</hi> who as they were both afterwards Emperors, were the firſt Two that ſate upon the Throne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and reigned in Conjunction with one another. The reaſon of giving to <hi>Arrius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> the Title of the <hi>Pious</hi> was, becauſe he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52508:46"/> ſhew'd himſelf ſo careful of his Father-in-Law in his great Years, that he led him by the Hand, as he went to, or came from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; or according to others, becauſe he was the Occaſion of the Preſervation of the Lives of ſeveral of the Senators, when <hi>Hadrian</hi> was in his Frenſie for killing them; or laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he performed great Honours to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Hadrian</hi> after his Death. However it is, there were many who regretted the Adoption of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Catilius Severus,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Rome;</hi> who was diligently paving himſelf a way to the Throne, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered, he was deprived of his Place, and another Perſon put into it. <hi>Hadrian</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient<note place="margin">His Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> under the laſt Pangs of Life, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Servant to run him through with a Sword. <hi>Antoninus</hi> being made acquainted with this, went in to him, in Company with the Officers of the Court, and beſeeching him to take his great Sickneſs, as it was unavoidable, with more conſtancy, he was angry at them, and commanded that the Diſcoverer of what he had ſaid to the Servant ſhould be put to Death. But <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſaved him, and ſaid, <hi>That he ſhould think himſelf a Parricide, if he ſhould ſuffer</hi> Hadrian, <hi>who had adopted him, to be murdered.</hi> Then he made his laſt Will, not forgetting therein the Intereſt of the State. He endeavoured, after he had made his Will, to kill himſelf with his own Hand. But the Weapon was wreſted from him; and this made him perfectly furious. He commanded a Phyſician to give him Poyſon, who, it is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52508:46"/> ſaid, choſe to kill himſelf upon the Place, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to Poyſon his Prince.</p>
                     <p>About this time, there came a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who ſaid, <hi>She had been admoniſhed in a Dream, that ſhe ſhould go and adviſe</hi> Hadrian <hi>not to kill himſelf, becauſe he would one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover;</hi> which ſhe not obſerving to do as ſhe was ordered, ſhe pretended ſhe had been ſtruck blind upon it. <hi>However,</hi> ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded upon the ſame Errand again,</hi> and told, <hi>that when ſhe had done it, and had kiſſed the Feet of</hi> Hadrian, <hi>ſhe ſhould receive her ſight;</hi> ſo ſhe did it, and ſhe received her Sight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, after waſhing her Eyes in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Temple from whence ſhe came. There came out of <hi>Pannonia</hi> to <hi>Hadrian,</hi> whilſt he was in a Fever, a Man, who alſo preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he had been long blind; who touching <hi>Hadrian,</hi> not only received his Sight, but alſo <hi>Hadrian</hi> was quitted of his Fever: that is, ſays Marius Maximus, <hi>Theſe things were all a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of the Contrivance of</hi> Antoninus, <hi>to heal the wounded imagination of</hi> Hadrian, <hi>and divert him from murdering himſelf.</hi> Then <hi>Hadrian</hi> went to <hi>Baiae,</hi> leaving <hi>Antoninus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> to govern: but nothing at that Place doing him good, he ſent for <hi>Antoninus</hi> to him, and died in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at <hi>Baiae</hi> upon the Sixth Day of the <hi>Ides</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Death</note> of <hi>July.</hi> A little before his Death, he ordered <hi>Servianus,</hi> who was Ninety Years old, as I ſaid, to be kill'd, only becauſe he ſhould not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live him, and as he imagined, gain the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Many others for pretended Offences he ordered likewiſe to be ſo ſerved; but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52508:47"/>

                     <p>He was the Author of ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Verſes of this ſort, which were not much better. He lived Seventy Two Years, Five Months, and Seventeen Days; and reigned Twenty One Years and Eleven Months. He was tall and well<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</note> made as to his Perſon; his Hair naturally Curling; a long Beard, which covered ſome Spots which he had upon his Face, and of a robuſt Conſtitution. He rid and walked very well; exerciſed himſelf conſtantly at Arms, and the Javelin; often hunted, and hath kill'd a Lion with his own hand; his Friends hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Company with him. At his Banquets, he had the divertiſements of Tragedies, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, Dancing, Muſicians, Rehearſers, and Poets. He built a Houſe at the City of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> which was an extraordinary Structure; and gave the Names of the <hi>Lycaeum, Academia,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52508:47"/> Prytanaeum, Canopus, Paecile,</hi> and <hi>Tempe,</hi> which are the moſt Famous Names of Places abroad, together with others of the Provinces, unto the ſeveral Parts of it; and that he might leave nothing undone to adorn it, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in another Part in Painting, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Regions. The Signs which fore-ſhew'd his Death, were theſe: As he was in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note place="margin">His Death fore-ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> on the laſt Anniverſary of his Birth, recommending <hi>Antoninus,</hi> his Son, to the Gods, the Lappet of his Robe which he threw over his Head, ſlipt down of it ſelf, and left him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. A Ring which had his Effigies cut upon it, fell in like manner of it ſelf, off his Finger. The Day before that, there came one, I know not who, ſcrieking and crying into the Senate; none of the Senate underſtood what he ſaid; but yet <hi>Hadrian</hi> was moved at him, as if he had ſaid ſomething concerning his Death: Speaking to the Senate, inſtead of <hi>poſt filii mei mortem,</hi> after the Death of my Son, which he intended to ſay, he ſaid, <hi>poſt mortem meam,</hi> after my Death. He dreamt that he had asked, and had obtained of his Father a Potion to make him ſleep: Another time, that he was oppreſſed by a Lion.</p>
                     <p>After his Death a great many Perſons ſpoke very hard things againſt him. The Senate would have made void his Acts; neither had he been deifyed, but that <hi>Antoninus</hi> begged it; who not only did this, but built a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to him at <hi>Pozzulo,</hi> and inſtituted in his Honour Games to be celebrated every Five Years, and appointed him his Prieſts and Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52508:48"/> with all other things belonging to the Service of a God. Upon which account it was, as many think at leaſt, and as I have already intimated, that the Title of the <hi>Pious</hi> was given to <hi>Antoninus.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>AS it is my Deſign, Sir, humbly to lay at the Feet of your Majeſty, who are the greateſt of ſo many Princes, an Account, not only of thoſe who have ſate upon the</hi> Roman <hi>Throne before you, as I have already done in the Princes from</hi> Julius Caeſar, <hi>down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Hadrina, <hi>but of thoſe alſo who either have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52508:49"/> been honoured with the Title of</hi> Caeſars, <hi>or upon any other Account have had the Reputation to be propoſed for the Crown, although they did not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſucceed to it. I cannot omit here the Life eſpecially of</hi> Aelius Verus Caeſar, <hi>who was incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into the Royal Family by the adoption of</hi> Hadrian, <hi>but enjoy'd the Name only of a</hi> Caeſar, <hi>and did not live to be Emperor. And becauſe there is but little to be ſaid of him, and the Preface ought not to be long in a ſuch ſmall Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as this, I immediately proceed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cejonius Commodus,</hi> or as he is otherwiſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aelius Verus,</hi> was adopted by <hi>Hadrian,</hi> when the Maladies of that Prince increaſing upon him with his Age, preſſed him to appoint his Succeſſour, after his return from his many Travels about the World. His Life affords us nothing that is more memorable than this, to wit, His Quality as a <hi>Caeſar;</hi> given him not by a laſt Will and Teſtament, as formerly it<note place="margin">
                              <hi>The ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of</hi> Caeſar.</note> had deſcended; nor yet was it given him in the manner, in which the Adoption of <hi>Trajan</hi> was by <hi>Nerva;</hi> but ſo as in our time, <hi>Maximia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius</hi> have been created <hi>Caeſars</hi> by your Majeſty; that is, to ſignify they are as it were, <hi>the Princes of the Blood,</hi> and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Heirs of the Empire. And becauſe it may be fit that ſomething here ſhould be ſaid concerning the Name of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> the Opinion of the moſt Learned about it, is, That he who was the firſt called ſo, was either called <hi>Caeſar</hi> from an Elephant, which in the Language of the <hi>Moors</hi> is called <hi>Caeſa,</hi> which he bravely ſlew
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52508:49"/> in the Field; or becauſe his Mother dying in her Labour with him, he was <hi>Ventre Caeſo natus,</hi> cut out of her Belly; or becauſe he was born <hi>cum magna Caeſarie,</hi> with much Hair upon his Head; or becauſe <hi>oculis Caeſiis viguerit,</hi> he had Grey Eyes, which were bright and vigorous to a Miracle. However it is, it was certainly a happy Neceſſity that was the occaſion of a Name ſo famous, which is like to be as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal as the World: The perſon, of whom we at preſent ſpeak, receiv'd it in virtue of his Adoption by <hi>Hadrian.</hi> His Father was <hi>Cejonius Commodus,</hi> whom others call <hi>Verus,</hi> others <hi>Lucius Aurelius,</hi> others <hi>Annius.</hi> All his<note place="margin">His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. his Wife.</note> Anceſtours were Perſons of good Quality, whoſe Original for the moſt part was out of the Country of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> or the City <hi>Faenza.</hi> Of which Family we ſhall have an occaſion to ſpeak more fully hereafter, in the Life of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Aurelius Cejonius Commodus Verus Antoninus,</hi> the Son of this <hi>Verus,</hi> whom <hi>Antoninus</hi> the <hi>Pious</hi> was commanded to Adopt. For in that Life will be contained every thing which concerns the Stem of this Houſe, as it gives an account of a Prince who hath a great many more things to be ſaid of him than this here.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Aelius Verus</hi> being Adopted by <hi>Hadrian,</hi>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52508:50"/> deſign'd for the Empire; he was appointed to be Conſul a ſecond time. A Largeſs was given to the People upon the occaſion of his Adoption, and three thouſand <hi>Seſtertiums</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Soldiers, and the Games of the Cirque Celebrated; ſo that nothing was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be done in order to proclaim a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Joy: and his Intereſt with <hi>Hadrian</hi> became<note place="margin">His Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in his Province.</note> in fine ſo great, that he alone obtained from him whatever he deſired, upon the leaſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he wrote to him. Nor was he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Province to which <hi>Hadrian</hi> preferred him. For although he might not ariſe to the fame of a Governour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of the higheſt Form; yet he managed his Affairs ſo well, or rather ſo fortunately, that he was eſteemed to come up to the next ſtep to that Character: but on the other Hand he was ſo ſickly and ſo feeble, that <hi>Hadrian</hi> ſoon repented himſelf of his Adoption, and perhaps if he could, he would willingly have removed him again, if he had lived, out of the Royal Family, becauſe he was often placing his thoughts on others, whom he might admit to the ſame. Some, who have been very diligent to Collect the Life of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> pretend to ſay, that <hi>Hadrian</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood very well the Nativity of <hi>Verus;</hi> and not ſo much approving him for a Perſon to make an Emperour of, he had Adopted him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſerve his Pleaſures, and to ſatisfie a certain Paſſion which he had conceived for him: and what upon this occaſion was acted betwixt him and <hi>Verus,</hi> was kept ſecret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Oath. Indeed that <hi>Hadrian</hi> was really
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52508:50"/> skilful in the Science of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> is what is ſo fully atteſted by <hi>Marius Maximus,</hi> that he ſays, that he Calculated the future Paſſages of all the days of his own life, to the very hour in which he dyed.</p>
                        <p>It is beſides certain enough, that <hi>Hadrian</hi> hath many times applied to <hi>Verus,</hi> out of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> theſe words;</p>
                        <q>

                        <p>Another time he expreſſed himſelf concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him thus, and laughed, <hi>I have Adopted my ſelf a God, and not a Son.</hi> Nor was the Event different from the Horoſcope which he had drawn of it: For when <hi>Aelius Verus</hi> was returned from his Province, and had provided himſelf a very fine Oration, which is now Extant; whether it was of his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, or that his Secretaries, or his Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians did it for him, in which, upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of <hi>January</hi> he was to have return'd his thanks to <hi>Hadrian</hi> for the honour which he had done him; he inſtead of that died upon<note place="margin">His Death.</note> that very day, and it was forbidden by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> to obſerve the Mourning for him then, becauſe of the Vows and the Congratulations intervening, which are the peculiar buſineſs Dedicated to the firſt day of <hi>January.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He was one who paſſed his time in a courſe<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> of Pleaſure, and had been inſtructed in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but more acceptable unto <hi>Hadrian,</hi> at leaſt as ſome would have it, more for the ſake of his Beauty, than any thing elſe. He had not been long at the Court. His private life, as it was not admirable nor much to be commended for his Virtues; ſo neither was it much ſubject to be reproached. He was mindful of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52508:51"/> into which he was Adopted. Went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neat and proper in his Dreſs; had the Meen and Air of a Prince, an obliging Aſpect, a handſome way of expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ready at the making of a Verſe, and no unfit Perſon for the Service of the State. Thoſe who have written his life, have made mention of a great many Pleaſures which he<note place="margin">His Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</note> delighted in; and which although they are not infamous, yet perhaps he was a little too much addicted to them. The Oglio of Pheaſants, Brawn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was <hi>Hadrians</hi> great Diſh, is ſaid to have been of the invention firſt of <hi>Aelius Verus.</hi> And another ſort of Pleaſure of his invention was this: he made himſelf a Bed with four Heads to it; that is to every Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it a Head, with Curtains all about of fine Net-work: and ſtrewing it full of the Leaves of pick'd Roſes, there he lay enjoying his Concubines, and his Company, covered with a Sheet of Flowers, and perfumed with the Odours of <hi>Perſia.</hi> He had always the Books of <hi>Ovid's Amorum</hi> upon the Bed with him, together with <hi>Martial</hi> the Epigramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, who he ſaid, was his <hi>Virgil.</hi> And not to omit his other, though more inconſiderable Actions; he gave his Lackeys and his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers Wings to their Cloaths, like ſo many <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids;</hi> and he called them by the names of the Winds. One he called <hi>Boreas,</hi> another <hi>Notus,</hi> another <hi>Aquilo</hi> or <hi>Circius,</hi> and ſo of the reſt: and he made them run perpetually, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully. He told his Wife, when ſhe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52508:52"/> complained, it is ſaid, to him, of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he took with other Women, <hi>A Wife was a Name of Honour, but not of Pleaſure; you will give me leave, Madam, to have my Pleaſures therefore elſewhere.</hi> His Son was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus Verus;</hi> who was Adopted at the ſame time with <hi>Mareus Antoninus;</hi> which two, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and <hi>Marcus,</hi> Reigning in Conjunction af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with one another, are they who are called the <hi>Duo Auguſti,</hi> in the Calendars of the Conſuls: Some of which Calendars have taken the Conſulſhips of the <hi>Duo Auguſti</hi> for the <hi>Aera,</hi> from which they Commence their Accounts of the Conſuls.</p>
                        <p>At the time of his Adoption, <hi>Hadrian</hi> ſpent an Infinite deal of Money upon the Soldiers and the People. But when he ſaw him ſo ſickly, and ſo far gone in health, that he had not the force left to manage a Shield, <hi>I have loſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the four thouſand Seſtertiums, which I ſpent upon the Soldiers and the People: I have lean'd my ſelf againſt a falling Wall, and upon a Man, who is ſo far from being able to ſupport the weight of the State, that he is no ſupport to my ſelf.</hi> This it ſeems he ſpoke to an Officer of the Houſhold, who repeated it again, till it came to the Ears of <hi>Aelius Verus:</hi> who growing every day worſe and worſe with the concern to be ſenſible, that he was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd of, <hi>Hadrian</hi> turned that Officer for diſcovering it, out of his place; and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſeem to mitigate, what he had ſaid; but this was all one. For in fine, as we have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52508:52"/> already ſaid, <hi>Lucius Cejonius Commodus Verus Aelius Caeſar,</hi> for he was called by all theſe names, died; and was buried with all the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies obſerved at the Funerals of Princes;<note place="margin">Honour done him at his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</note> the only Royal honour, which he ever had, being thoſe at his death. <hi>Hadrian,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted his death like a good Father, was a long time afterwards dubious upon what he ſhould do: at laſt he Adopted <hi>Antoninus</hi> the <hi>Pious,</hi> as he was called; upon whom he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this condition, that <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Adopt <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Verus,</hi> and ſhould Marry his Daughter, not to <hi>Marcus,</hi> but to <hi>Verus.</hi> And this was one of the laſt things he ſpoke to. He had been uſed to ſay; that a Prince ought to dye ſound of mind. Then he grew worſe, and the Complication of his Maladies carried him off.</p>
                        <p>He had ordered large Statues to be ſet up in all parts to the honour of <hi>Aelius Verus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> in ſome Cities and Temples. Alſo he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Son, whom he had obliged <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to Adopt, into the Royal Family, as his own Grandſon; often ſaying, Let the Empire have all that it can of <hi>Aelius Verus. Verus</hi> the Son brought no ſmall Luſtre to the Imperial Family, eſpecially by his Clemency. This is what I have thought fit to obſerve concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aelius Verus Caeſar:</hi> whom I would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, becauſe I have made it my reſolution to write the Hiſtory of all thoſe, who ſince <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar,</hi> the Emperour, have been either called Emperours, or <hi>Caeſars,</hi> or have been

                        <hi>TItus Aurelius Fulvius Bononius Antoninus,</hi> called the <hi>Pious,</hi> derived his Origin by his Father's ſide, from <hi>Niſmes</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc.</hi> His Grandfather by his Father's ſide<note place="margin">His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> was <hi>Titus Aurelius Fulvius,</hi> who through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52508:54"/> other Honours, came to be twice a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, and to be the Governour of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> His Father was <hi>Aurelius Fulvius,</hi> who was alſo a Conſul, and a Perſon of great Virtue and Integrity. His Mother was <hi>Arria Fadilla.</hi> His Grandmother by his Mother's ſide, <hi>Bojo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Procilla.</hi> His Grandfather by the ſame ſide, <hi>Arrius Antoninus</hi> who was twice Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, and a holy virtuous Man; who inſtead of Congratulating, compaſſionated <hi>Nerva,</hi> to ſee him advanced to that difficult Station of a Prince. His Wife's Father was <hi>Julius Lupus,</hi> a Conſul. His Siſter, by the ſame Venter, was <hi>Julia Fadilla.</hi> His Wife was <hi>Annia Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina:</hi> by whom he had two Sons and two Daughter. The eldeſt Daughter married <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia Syllanus:</hi> the yonger to <hi>Marcus Antoninus. Antoninus Pius</hi> was born at a Seat near <hi>Lavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> in the <hi>Campagna di Roma,</hi> upon the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the Calends of <hi>October,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhips of <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Dolabella;</hi> which was then the twelfth time of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip of <hi>Domitian.</hi> He was brought up at another Seat, called <hi>Laurium,</hi> upon the <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> way: where he afterwards built a Palace, which hath ſome remains of it, ſtanding at this day. He paſſed his Infancy hetwixt his two Grandfathers, ſometimes with the one, and ſometimes the other; and being very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and obſervant to all his Relations, ſeveral of them left their Eſtates to him, which made him very Rich.</p>
                     <p>He was handſome as to his Perſon, full of<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> Wit, of a ſweet and courteous Behaviour, a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52508:54"/> generous Countenance, Eaſie, Eloquent, and of a polite Literature. He was Sober, a great lover of the Country and Agriculture; Mild, Bountiful; not coveting other Men's Goods; Diſcreet, and all this without Vanity. He was every thing, which is commendable; and may be very juſtly compared with <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> according to the Opinion of moſt good Men. The Senate conferred upon him<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Why ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd the</hi> Pious.</note> the Title of the <hi>Pious,</hi> either becauſe he was uſed to lead by the Hand, in their ſight, his decrepit Father-in-Law to and from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; (tho' it would, be rather, an impious thing not to diſcharge ſuch a Devoir, than it is an Argument of great Piety to do it;) or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was he, who had preſerved the lives of thoſe whom <hi>Hadrian</hi> in his Frenzy had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be murdered; or becauſe he decreed ſuch infinite and unexpected Honours, to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> his Father, after his death; or becauſe when <hi>Hadrian</hi> would have killed himſelf, he hindred him from it with all the care he could; or laſtly, becauſe he was in his Nature a moſt mild Perſon, and had done nothing that was diſoblinging or Cruel in all his life. He lent out his Money at the ſmall Intereſt of four <hi>per Cent.</hi> to aſſiſt the Poor in their Occaſions, with that Fortune which he had. He was a generous Queſtor; ſplendid and noble when he was a Praetor, and Conſul in Conjunction with <hi>Catilius Severus.</hi> He lived for the moſt part in the Country, all the time he was a private man; but wherever he was, he was in great renown. So that when <hi>Hadrian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52508:55"/> the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> unto the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of four Proconſuls, he made a choice of him to be one of them, to Govern in that part where he had the greateſt Eſtate: in which he equally conſulted the Honour and the Repoſe of this great Perſon.</p>
                     <p>He received an Omen of his future Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Empire, in the time of this his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.<note place="margin">Omens of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> For amongſt the Acclamations which were made to him, as he ſat upon the Bench in the Court, ſome cried, <hi>Auguſte, Dii te ſervent; The Gods ſave your Majeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>
                        </hi> Next he was made the Proconſul of <hi>Aſia:</hi> where he behaved himſelf ſo well, that he alone out-did his Grandfather <hi>Arrius Antoninus;</hi> the Equity of whoſe Government no Perſon had ever ſurpaſſed before. In this Proconſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he received another good Omen of his future Reign. The Prieſts, at the City of <hi>Tralles</hi> in <hi>Lydia,</hi> who according to Cuſtom ſaluted the Proconſuls upon their arrival there with an <hi>Ave Proconſul,</hi> did not ſay <hi>Ave</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul to <hi>Antoninus,</hi> but <hi>Ave Imperator, Hail, O Emperour.</hi> At the City <hi>Ciziqua</hi> upon the <hi>Propontis,</hi> a Crown which before ſtood upon the Head of an Image of a God, was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from thence, and found upon a Statue of <hi>Antoninus.</hi> His Statues throughout all the Country of <hi>Hetruria</hi> were covered with ſwarms of Bees. As he went to <hi>Aſia,</hi> he loſt his eldeſt Daughter. His Wife, they ſay; 'was one that contracted a great many Cenſures, by the too great Liberties which ſhe allowd herſelf in her Life and Converſation; which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52508:55"/> 
                        <hi>Antoninus</hi> diſſembled as much as he could; but not without ſome trouble to ſupport her Credit. After his Proconſulſhip, he lived or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily at <hi>Rome:</hi> where he was of the Council to <hi>Hadrian;</hi> and in all things upon which <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> conſulted him, he made appear the ſweetneſs of his Sentiments; and gave his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict always on the moſt mild and merciful ſide.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion of his Adoption was thus,<note place="margin">His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</note> When <hi>Aelius Verus Caeſar</hi> died, whom <hi>Hadrian</hi> had Adopted in order to ſucceed in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, a day being appointed for the Senate to Aſſemble; <hi>Antoninus</hi> came amongſt the reſt, leading and ſupporting by the Hand his decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit Father-in-Law; which was ſo agreeable a ſight, that <hi>Hadrian,</hi> ſome ſay, Adopted him for that very reaſon. But yet this could not be all: becauſe <hi>Antoninus</hi> was one, who challenged his conſideration upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. For he had always executed his part in the Government very well, and in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſulſhip had approved himſelf a Perſon of great Fidelity and Ability. Therefore when <hi>Hadrian</hi> had declared to the World that it was his intention to Adopt him, he took a time to deliberate with himſelf, whether he ſhould conſent to it, or no. This Condition was impoſed upon him; that as <hi>Hadrian</hi> did A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt him, ſo he ſhould Adopt <hi>Marcus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi> who was his Wife's Brother's Son; and <hi>Lucius Verus,</hi> who was afterwards called <hi>Verus Antoninus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aelius Verus Caeſar</hi> who had been the firſt Adopted by <hi>Hadrian.</hi> So <hi>Antoninus</hi> was Adopted upon the fifth of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52508:56"/> Calends of <hi>March;</hi> and having thanked <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> in the Senate for the great honour which he had done him; he received the Proconſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and the Tribunitian Powers upon him, as a Colleague in the Empire with his Father. Then he preſented the Soldiers and the People with a Largeſs upon this occaſion; he g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ve them beſides, what his Father <hi>Hadrian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them. He contributed a great deal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Works of <hi>Hadrian.</hi> The Tribute which upon the occaſion of his Adoption was preſented him by <hi>Italy</hi> and the Provinces, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> remitted wholly to the firſt, and a Moiety of it to the latter: and he was moſt religiouſly Obſervant of <hi>Hadrian</hi> all the time that they afterwards lived together.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Hadrian</hi> died at <hi>Baiae, Antotinus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved<note place="margin">His Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour when Emperor.</note> his Reliques with all due Reſpect and Ceremony to <hi>Rome:</hi> where he laid him in State in the Gardens of <hi>Domitian;</hi> and though contrary to the general Opinion, he cauſed him to be received as a God. The Senate gave to <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> who was the Conſort of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> the Title of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> which he permitted. To himſelf they gave the Title of <hi>Pius;</hi> he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it. He accepted very freely the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which they likewiſe decreed to the honour of his deceaſed Father, Mother, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and Brothers. He accepted the Games of the <hi>Cirque,</hi> which were appointed to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his Birth-day. But other Honours which they offered him he refuſed. He hung up a moſt magnificent Shield to the honour of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> and appointed him his Prieſts. He
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52508:56"/> removed none of thoſe, out of their Places, after he was Emperour, who had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by <hi>Hadrian.</hi> He continued the ſame Perſons Preſidents and Governours, ſeven or nine year's together, if they deſerved it, he was ſo little given to change. He made many Wars by his Lieutenants. He overcame the <hi>Britains</hi> by <hi>Lollius Urbicus:</hi> who at the ſame time repulſed the Barbarians, and built ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wall, which was of Turf, in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for a Partition betwixt the <hi>Roman-Britains</hi> and them. He forced the <hi>Moors</hi> to ſue to him for a Peace; he <hi>Germans,</hi> the <hi>Daci,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Nations. The <hi>Jews</hi> in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion were repreſſed by his Preſidents, and his Commanders. He repreſſed the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in <hi>Achaia</hi> and <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and the <hi>Alani</hi> in their Attempts were conſtrained to contain themſelves within due Bounds.</p>
                     <p>He ordered that his Receivers ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with all moderation in gathering the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of the Provinces. If they exceeded their proper limits, he called them by his Authority to an account; becauſe he was never pleaſed with a Gain, by which the Subject was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. He was always willing to hearken to the Complaints, which were made againſt his Officers and his Receivers. He moved the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for a full Indemnity for thoſe whom <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> had in his Frenzy condemned to die; becauſe he ſaid, Hadrian <hi>himſelf, had he lived, would have done it.</hi> He mixt the Grandeur and the Majeſty of an Emperour with all the Civility of a Gentleman; which the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52508:57"/> to his Grandeur. His method as to Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was, not to paſs it through the Hands of others, but to ſpeak to the Party himſelf: which diſabled the Courtiers from amuſing and cheating People out of their Money, at any time, with empty Pretences. He paid as great a reſpect to the Senate, when Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as he could wiſh, when he was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man, it ſhould receive from any other Prince. The Title of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Country; which the Senate gave him, but which he had declined to accept in the beginning, he afterwards received with a great deal of thanks. In the third Year of<note place="margin">Honour done to</note> his Reign he loſt his Conſort <hi>Fauſtina.</hi> The Senate Conſecrated her a Goddeſs. They appointed her a Temple and Prieſteſſes; Games in her honour, and Statues of Gold and Silver. And <hi>Antoninus</hi> ordered that her Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies ſhould be carried in the Proceſſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the Games of the <hi>Cirque.</hi> He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the honour of having his own Statue ſet up in Gold, which the Senate had decreed him. He created <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> from a Quaeſtor a Conſul, at the Prayer of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. He created <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called <hi>Verus Antoninus,</hi> a Quaeſtor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the due time by the Law. He Enacted nothing, neither concerning the Provinces, nor any other Affairs without the advice of his Miniſters, and then he formed his Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to their Judgments.

For <hi>Antoninus</hi> forbad the Senate to enquire into his Accomplices, and continued his Kindneſs even to his Son, always in all things. It is true, <hi>Priſcianus</hi> died alſo, for having favoured him: But his Death was what he voluntarily committed upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and he ſuffered no more ſearch to be made into that Conſpiracy.

                        <hi>Antoninus</hi> was ſuch, as to be Rich without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, and Frugal without any unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs: His own Servants furniſhed it: His own Fowlers, Fiſhers, and Huntſmen. He expoſed the uſe of his own Bath to the People, <hi>gratis;</hi> and alter'd in nothing from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of his private Life. He ſubtracted Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from ſuch as he ſaw did nothing for them to deſerve them; becauſe he ſaid, <hi>It was moſt abſurd and cruel, to ſuffer that a State ſhould be pilled and gnawed by Perſons who contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it by their Service, but live in Idleneſs.</hi> He diminiſhed the Penſion of <hi>Meſomedes,</hi> the <hi>Lyrick</hi> Poet of <hi>Crete.</hi> He informed himſelf in the Accounts of all the Provinces and their Tribute perfectly well. He gave his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Paternal Eſtate, but yet ſo, as to hold

He ſold ſuch of the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Palace, and all Superfluities, as had only ſerved for the Luxury of former Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and lived by times, according to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at his own private Seats. He took no Journeys, but to go to his own Lands in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania;</hi> becauſe he ſaid, <hi>The Retinue of a Prince is always heavy upon the Country through which he paſſes, let him be as ſparing as he can.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, his Authority was great amongſt all Foreign Nations, whilſt he kept himſelf in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Heart and Centre, as it were, of the Empire; where by his Expreſſes, he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily received the News of all Parts.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Arguments of the Piety of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi> this is one; that as <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> was weeping for the Death of one who had been his Educator, and the Courtiers would have diverted him from it, as an unſuitable Oſtentation of the Kindneſs which he had for him, he ſaid to them, <hi>Give him leave to be, as he is, a Man; for neither Philoſophy nor an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire takes our Natural Affections from us.</hi> The Officers of the Provinces in his time, received
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52508:60"/> from him, not only great Preſents, but ſuch as had not been Conſuls, he honoured with the Marks of thoſe that had. But if he found them guilty of Extortion and Bribery, tho' he reſtored the Fortunes of Fathers unto the Children, yet he did it under this Condition; that the Children ſhould reſtore to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces all that their Fathers had unjuſtly ſtoln from thence. He had all the Inclinations imaginable to Acts of Grace and Pardon. In the publick Shews which he gave the People, he produced Elephants, Rhinocerots, Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles, Sea-Horſes, Tygers, and all ſorts of Beaſts from all Parts of the World. He hath expoſed a Hundred Lions together at one Shew.</p>
                     <p>His behaviour towards his Friends in his Reign, was juſt the ſame as before, when he was a private Perſon; and neither they, not his Servants, whom he manumitted, pretended to make any Gain to themſelves of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him; particularly, he was very ſtrict with the Latter. He was much delighted with<note place="margin">His Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</note> the Diverſions of the Comedians, and in Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hunting, Walking, and Talking with his Miniſters, to whoſe Entertainments he went; and ſometimes to the Feaſts of the Vintage. He gave Honours and Recompences in Money, in the Provinces, to the Rhetoricians and the Philoſophers. The Speeches which are extant under his Name, are ſaid by many to have been of the Compoſition of another: but <hi>Marius Maximus</hi> ſays they are truly his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52508:60"/> own. He made Entertainments for his Friends in particular, and in publick. He never Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed by a Proxy, unleſs he was Sick. When he deſired any Honour for himſelf or his Sons, he did all things as a private Candidate in the ſame Caſe. He dined with his Miniſters many times at their Houſes. He went one time to ſee the Houſe of <hi>Omulus;</hi> where admiring the Porphyry-Pillars which he had, and asking him from whence he procured them, <hi>Omulus</hi> ſaid, <hi>When you came, Sir, into a Strangers Houſe, you are to be both Dumb and Deaf.</hi> He took this patiently, as he did a great many other Jeſts of the ſame Perſon.</p>
                     <p>He made divers Laws, in which he ſerved<note place="margin">His Laws.</note> himſelf of the beſt Lawyers of his time, who were <hi>Vinidius Verus, Salvius Valens, Voluſius Metianus, Ulpius Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Jabolenus.</hi> He put an end to whatever Seditions in any Part aroſe; not by Force and Cruelty, but by the Modeſty and the Gravity of his Judgments. He prohibited the burying of the Dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City. He limited the Expences of the Games of the Gladiators. He facilitated things for the convenience of Travelling with all the Care he could. He gave Reaſons for every thing he did, either to the Senate or in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts. He died in his Seventieth Year, but was<note place="margin">His Death.</note> as much lamented, then, as if it had been in the flower of his Age: And the manner of his Death, they ſay, was this; he had eaten with great Appetite at Supper, of the Cheeſe which is made upon the <hi>Alps,</hi> but he brought it up
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52508:61"/> again in the Night, and the next Day was taken with a Fever; the third Day being worſe, he recommended the Empire, and the Care of his Daughter unto <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> in the preſence of the Court. Then he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Golden Image of <hi>Fortune,</hi> which always ſtands in the Emperor's Bed-Chamber, to be removed out of his Room into that of <hi>Marcus Antoninus.</hi> Then he gave the word to the Tribune, which was <hi>Equanimity;</hi> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf as it were to ſleep, he died at his own Seat at <hi>Laurium.</hi> He was light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in his Fever; at which times, all his Diſcourſe was concerning the State, and the Kings who had given him an occaſion of Diſpleaſure. He left his Paternal Eſtate to his Daughter, and Legacies by his Will to all his Domeſticks.</p>
                     <p>He was tall and graceful; but being apt to<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</note> ſtoop a little in his old Age, he then wore a pair of Bodice on purpoſe to keep himſelf ſtrait. In a morning, when he grew in years, before he was viſited, he eat a little dry Bread for his Health. He ſpoke a little broad, but yet agreeably enough The Senate made him a God, in which all People were forward to concur with them, becauſe his Goodneſs, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, Wit, and Sanctimony were univerſally eſteemed. They decreed him all the Honours which had ever been beſtowed upon the beſt Princes. They appointed him an Order of Prieſts of his own Name, a Temple, and the Honour of the Games of the <hi>Cirque.</hi> He was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52508:61"/> abſolutely the only one of all the Emperors who lived without having ever ſhed the Blood either of Citizen or Enemy; and as his Reign was attended with the ſame Felicity and Goodneſs, the ſame Security and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſneſs, with that of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> he may very well be put in the Compariſon with that Prince. He reigned Twenty Three Years.</p>

                        </gap>n very great Reſpect. His Maſters to teach him Grammar were, for the Greek, <hi>Alexander;</hi> for the Latin, <hi>Troſius Aper, Pollio,</hi> and <hi>Eutychius Proculus</hi> of <hi>Sicca</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> His-Maſters to teach him Rhetorick, were for the Greek, <hi>Annius Marcus, Caninius Celer,</hi> and <hi>Herodes Atticus;</hi> for the Latin, <hi>Fronto Cornelius;</hi> amongſt all which, he had a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for <hi>Fronto,</hi> and deſired the Senate to ſet up his Statue; and <hi>Proculus</hi> he advanced to be a Proconſul. He applied himſelf extremely to the Study of Philoſophy, whilſt he was but yet a Youth. In his Twelfth Year he entred<note place="margin">And Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</note> himſelf amongſt the Philoſophers, wore their Habit, practiſed their Severities, ſtudied as they did, lay upon the Ground, and was with great
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52508:63"/> Difficulty perſuaded by his Mother to make uſe of an ordinary Couch. <hi>Commodus,</hi> whoſe Daughter it was deſigned that he ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was another of his Maſters; and alſo <hi>Apollonius</hi> a <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſopher of <hi>Chalcis</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such was his great Love to the Study of Philoſophy, that after his adoption into the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Family, he went himſelf to the Houſe of <hi>Apollonius</hi> to learn there of him. He likewiſe went to hear the Dictates of <hi>Sextus</hi> a Philoſopher of <hi>Chaeronea</hi> in <hi>Beotia,</hi> and the Kinſman of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> as alſo <hi>Junius Ruſticus, Claudius Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Cinſia Catullus,</hi> all <hi>Stoicks.</hi> For the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick Philoſophy he heard <hi>Claudius Severus.</hi> Amongſt theſe, he had particularly a Reſpect<note place="margin">His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors.</note> for <hi>Junius Ruſticus,</hi> and followed him; being one who was not only excellent at the <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophy, but a very underſtanding Perſon beſides, whether in Peace or War. With him he communicated all his publick and private Counſels: He ſaluted him always before he did the Captain of the Guards: He made him twice Conſul, and after his Death, deſired the Senate to ſet up his Statue. He had that great Honour for his other Maſters, that he ſet up their Images in Gold in his Cloſet, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited their Sepulchres, which he adorned with Crowns, and Victims, and Flowers. To all this, he ſtudied the Law, in which he heard the Dictates of <hi>Lucius Voluſius Metianus.</hi> In fine, the Labour and the Travel which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in Study, really affected his Health; his exceſs in it, was the only Fault of his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52508:64"/> Youth. He went often to the Declamations at the Publick Schools. His fellow Students, whom he more particularly loved, were <hi>Sejus Fuſcianus,</hi> and <hi>Aufidius Victorinus,</hi> of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorian Families: and <hi>Baebius Longus,</hi> and <hi>Calenus,</hi> of the Gentlemen: to whom he was very generous, and ſuch as he could not for the condition of their lives prefer to Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he inriched by other means.</p>
                     <p>He was Educated in ſome ſort in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> who called him, as I have ſaid, <hi>Annius Veriſſimus,</hi> and at ſix years of Age conferred a mark of Honour upon him, and at eight years of Age, put him into the College of the Prieſts of <hi>Mars:</hi> in which he paſſed through the ſeveral Functions and Offices of that Order, not without receiving an Omen there of his ſucceſſion to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He put on the <hi>Roman,</hi> that is, the Man's Gown in his fifteenth year; and preſently the<note place="margin">He is Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> Daughter of <hi>Lucius Cejonius Commodus</hi> was Contracted to him, according to the laſt Will of <hi>Hadrian.</hi> He was left the Governour of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the interim whilſt the Conſuls went to the Sacrifices of the <hi>Latinae Feriae</hi> upon Mount <hi>Alban.</hi> In which honour he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf to the general Approbation. He releaſed all his Paternal Eſtate to his Siſter. His Mother would have adviſed him to divide it only; but he ſaid, he was contented with the Eſtate of his Grandfather; and if ſhe pleaſed, ſhe alſo might give his Siſter her Eſtate to make her the better match for her Husband: He had ſo much complaiſance for others,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52508:64"/> that he ſuffered himſelf to be perſuaded, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt his will, to go either to the Chaſes of the Amphitheatre, or the Plays of the Stage, or other Shews. He learnt Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which his Maſter was <hi>Diognetus.</hi> He<note place="margin">His Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> loved the Games of Fencing, Wreſtling, Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Fowling and Hunting, for Exerciſe. He played at the Ball. But above all theſe things the ſtudy of Philoſophy gained his Heart; and rendred him perfectly grave and ſerious. Not but that yet he was in all reſpects obliging and courteous to every one; eſpecially his Friends, and ſuch as were but in the leaſt known to him. So that he was Reſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Opiniatrety, Modeſt without Flatneſs, and Grave without Auſtereneſs.</p>
                     <p>This being his Character, when <hi>Hadrian,</hi> after the death of <hi>Aelius Verus Caeſar</hi> was to chuſe ſome other Perſon to be his Succeſſour in the Empire, which this Youth was not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for as yet, upon the account of his Age, being then only eighteen years old; he A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted <hi>Antoninus</hi> the <hi>Pious,</hi> who was Uncle to him, under a condition that <hi>Pius</hi> ſhould Adopt <hi>Marcus,</hi> and that <hi>Marcus</hi> ſhould A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt <hi>Lucius Commodus Verus. Marcus</hi> received<note place="margin">His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</note> the News of his Adoption, more with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, than Joy; and when he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be removed into a Houſe of <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s, it was with an unwilling mind, that he took his leave of that of his Mother. Inſomuch that his Servants asking him, why he came ſo ſad into the Royal Family, he reaſoned with them upon the Evils which are contained in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52508:65"/> the life of a Prince. Then he began firſt to be called, inſtead of <hi>Annius, Marcus Aurelius;</hi> becauſe by the Right of his Adoption he was Tranſlated into the <hi>Aurelian</hi> Family, that is, into that of <hi>Antoninus Pius.</hi> This was in the eighteenth year of his Age, under the Second Conſulſhip of <hi>Antoninus</hi> his (now) Father: and the Senate diſpenſing with him, as to that Age, at the requeſt of <hi>Hadrian</hi> he was made a Quaeſtor. He paid to all his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, after he was Adopted, the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects altogether, as before. He obſerved his Studies as much, and was as good a Husband of his Expences: and he reſigned himſelf wholly both to act, ſpeak, and think, according to the inſtructions of his Father.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Hadrian</hi> dyed at <hi>Baiae,</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> was alſo gone thither to remove his Body to <hi>Rome; Marcus Antoninus</hi> was left at <hi>Rome</hi> to order the Funeral Obſequies of his Grandfather; and being then Quaeſtor, he exhibited to the People the Games of the Gladiatours. Now <hi>Hadrian</hi> had ordered, when he Adopted <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> that <hi>Pius</hi> ſhould Marry his Daughter to <hi>Verus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aelius Verus Caeſar,</hi> and that the Daughter of <hi>Lucius Cejonius Commodus</hi> ſhould Marry <hi>Marcus Antoninus.</hi> But <hi>Verus</hi> was not as yet of an Age for that Daughter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Hadrian</hi> was dead, it was thought fit by <hi>Pius</hi> and his Empreſs, to break off the Match of <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> with the Daughter of <hi>Commodus,</hi> and to Marry their own Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Fauſtina</hi> to him; to which <hi>Marcus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. Hereupon <hi>Pius</hi> advanced him, from
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52508:65"/> a Quaeſtor, to be Conſul in Conjunction with himſelf, and gave him the Title of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> He made him one of the ſix <hi>Seviri;</hi> and honoured him with his preſence at his Publick Games. He appointed his Apartments in the Court, and ordered him to be there attended (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his own Inclination) with all Pomp and Ceremony. He paſſed him thro' the Colleges of the Prieſts, according to the deſire of the Senate. He made him a ſecond time Conſul with himſelf; when himſelf entred upon his fourth Conſulſhip. But at the ſame time that <hi>Marcus</hi> was poſſeſſed of theſe high Honours, and aſſiſted at all things which his Father did in order to be formed to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Empire, he went paſſionately nevertheleſs to his Studies. He married <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His wife and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> by whom he had a Daughter. Then the Tribunitian, and the Proconſular Powers were given him, and the right of a fifth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: ſo that his Intereſt became ſo great, that his Father never eaſily Promoted any one without him. He was always the moſt duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Father, that it was poſſible for any one to be; howſoever ſome were willing to whiſper <hi>Pius</hi> in the Ear with things againſt him; particularly <hi>Valerius Omulus;</hi> who one day taking notice of <hi>Calvilla</hi> the Mother of <hi>Marcus,</hi> as ſhe was at her Devotions in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before an Image of <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſays he to <hi>Pius, That Lady there is now Praying for your death, and for the Reign of her Son.</hi> But this was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of no weight with him: becauſe he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52508:66"/> what Modeſty he carried himſelf under the Honour of his Aſcenſion to the degree of a Prince.</p>
                     <p>He was ſo careful to weigh all things well, to preſerve his Reputation, that in his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful years he always ordered his Servants to do nothing that was hard upon any body; and ſometimes when Eſtates were left to him, he refuſed them, if he could, to give them to the next of the Family, He lived three and twenty years together in the Court with his Father, and yet he was every day beloved more and more; and in all that time he was not abſent from him above two nights. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> came to dye, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Miniſters and his Friends about him; and recommended to them all, <hi>Marcus,</hi> as his Succeſſour in the Empire. He gave the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune the Word, which was <hi>Aequanimity,</hi> and immediately he ordered the Golden Image of <hi>Fortune,</hi> which ſtood in his Bedchamber, to be tranſlated into the Bed-chamber of <hi>Marcus.</hi> After the death of <hi>Pius,</hi> the Senate conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52508:66"/> this Conjunction, they inlarged the Charity of their Predeceſſors, for the Maintenance of the Children of poor Families, and added other Penſions to them. From the Senate, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having finiſhed their Affairs there, they both went together to the Camp of the Guards: where they promiſed the Soldiers a Bounty of twenty thouſand Seſterces, and to the Officers proportionably, as uſual, upon the occaſion of their joynt Reigns. They made a magnificent Funeral for their Father, whom they interred in the Sepulchre of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian.</hi> They proceeded to Conſecrate him a God. Each made an Oration in Publick in his Praiſe; and having appointed him his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſts out of the number of his Friends, they diſtinguiſhed them, by calling them after the name of his Family.</p>
                     <p>Poſſeſſed thus of the Empire, they both<note place="margin">Their good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> comported themſelves ſo well, that none could complain of the loſs of the gentle Reign of <hi>Pius. Marullus,</hi> the Satyrical Poet of that time, had ſome flings at them, but he paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed. They concluded the Funeral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies of their Father, with the Games of the Gladiatours. In the mean time <hi>Marcus</hi> gave himſelf ſtill to Philoſophy, and courted the love of the People. But the felicity and the quiet of their Reigns was interrupted, firſt by an Inundation of the <hi>Tyber,</hi> which was very terrible. It not only carried away ſeveral Buildings of the City, and deſtroyed a great many Cattle, but it produced a moſt grievous Famine: which Calamities were moderated
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52508:67"/> as much as poſſible by the Care and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Verus.</hi> Then the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>

But no ſooner was <hi>Marcus</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> but he received advice, that <hi>Verus</hi> was ſick at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa</hi> in <hi>Naples.</hi> He offered his Vows in the Senate for his Recovery, and then went in all haſte to ſee him there: and being return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> the ſecond time, he next received an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that <hi>Verus</hi> was ſafely arrived in <hi>Syria;</hi> where he paſſed his time in Sports and Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lived at <hi>Antioch</hi> and the Village of <hi>Daphne</hi> in the greateſt pleaſure, whilſt his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals carried on the <hi>Parthian</hi> War; in which they had the Victory of the Enemy.

                     <p>The Affairs of <hi>Armenia</hi> were proſperous,<note place="margin">Their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</note> and the City <hi>Teflis</hi> upon the <hi>Araxis</hi> was taken by <hi>Statius Priſcus.</hi> Hereupon both the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours were preſented with the Title of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> which <hi>Marcus</hi> in modeſty firſt at refuſed, but afterwards accepted.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52508:68"/> to take care, that ſhe was not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by any in her Journey.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed, <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Publick Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> made a Law, which is an extraordinary ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to People, in caſes concerning their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; he was the firſt that contrived it, and it is thus; he ordered every <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, who had a Child born, to enter the name of the Child before the Treaſurers of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> within thirty days. In the Provinces he erected Publick Notaries, before whom the ſame thing ſhould be done upon the Births there, as before the Treaſurers of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo that when any Perſon born in any Province hath a Cauſe in Hand concerning his Freedom, he hath no more to do, than to bring from that Province a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate of his Birth; this corroborated the whole Law concerning Freedoms. He made other Laws concerning Bankers and Auctions.</p>
                     <p>In divers Cauſes, in which himſelf eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially<note place="margin">Great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Senate.</note> was concerned, he made the Senate the Judge. He ordered, that Actions, having reference to the Freedom or Servitude of Perſons Defunct, ſhould be brought within five years from their deaths, or be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded for ever. No Prince ever deferred more to the Senate than he. He delegated to ſeveral of them, of the degree of Praetors and Conſuls, the deciſion of many Affairs; only that their command ſo far in the Law ſhould be a means to poſſeſs them with the greater Honour. He admitted ſeveral of his Relations into the Senate, whom he had made
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52508:68"/> 
                        <hi>Aediles</hi> or <hi>Praetors.</hi> He granted to ſeveral Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours, that were poor, provided that it was without reproach, the Offices of Tribunes and Aediles. He made no one a Senatour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had a very good knowledge of him. In this alſo he ſhew'd his reſpect to them, that whenever a Senatour underwent a Tryal for his life, he heard him firſt in private, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tryed him in publick; and he ſuffered none of the Order of the Knights and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to aſſiſt in ſuch a Caſe. He went con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, as much as poſſible, to the Senate, though he had nothing to propoſe to them, if he was at <hi>Rome:</hi> but when he had any thing to propoſe to them, he came in Perſon to do it, if it were out of <hi>Campagnia.</hi> He often aſſiſted in the Courts of Judicature, till it was night; and never withdrew out of the Senate till the Conſul himſelf diſmiſt it. He made the Senate the Judge in caſes of Appeals from the Conſuls. He ſhew'd himſelf very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent upon all Judiciary matters. He marked out the Law-days in the Kalendar, when Buſineſs was to be done, and Cauſes tryed. In the whole year, they were to the number of two hundred and thirty. He firſt gave the Praetors a power to appoint Guardians to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, who before were appointed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Conſuls; which he did, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite the Actions in that caſe.</p>
                     <p>He regulated the exceſs of the Publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in Feaſts and Games. He interpoſed againſt the Trade of Informers; and when he found them falſe, he branded them. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52508:69"/> the Accuſations, which were ſuggeſted to him to enrich his <hi>Exchequer.</hi> He contrived many things very Prudently relating to the Publick Stores. He made Senatours the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours to ſeveral Cities; to extend ſo much the more, the glory of their Order. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> in a time of great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, with Corn ſent from <hi>Rome.</hi> He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after every thing, that concerned the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines of Corn. He moderated the Games of the Gladiatours, all manner of ways. He diminiſh'd the Gratuities, given to, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the Comedians. He took a great care of the Streets of the City, and the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. He appointed Officers over the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Italy,</hi> for the Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in the Nature of the Proconſuls, which had been before appointed by <hi>Hadrian.</hi> He repeopled <hi>Spain,</hi> which was exhauſted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Levyes, with Colonies from <hi>Italy.</hi> In which contravening the Ordinances of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,</hi> he expreſſed himſelf with great modeſty and reſpect to the memory of that Prince. He added other Laws concerning the Tax called <hi>Viceſſima,</hi> the Tutelage of Servants, Maternal Eſtates, and the ſucceſſion of the Children unto them. He ordered, that ſuch Senatours, who were Foreigners, ſhould however buy themſelves a fourth of their Eſtates in <hi>Italy.</hi> He gave power to the Curatours of the Towns and the Highways either to puniſh, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Governour of <hi>Rome</hi> to be puniſhed, ſuch as exacted more from any Perſons, than what they were juſtly taxed to. As to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52508:69"/> reſt, he rather reſtored the old Laws, than created new ones. He had Lawyers always with him, by whoſe Opinion, and according to whoſe Forms he gave Sentence in Law, and publiſhed his Ordinances. Particularly <hi>Scaevola,</hi> was one excellent Lawyer that he much uſed.</p>
                     <p>The People lived under him, altogether as<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> in a Free-City. He was extremely well diſpoſed in all things, to deter Perſons from evil, and to invite them to good. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded plentifully, and pardoned graciouſly: he made them of ill, good Men; and of good Men, he made them extraordinary good. He took a Raillery upon theſe occaſions very patiently. One <hi>Veteraſinus,</hi> who was of an ill Fame, begging an honourable Employment of him, he adviſed him to clear himſelf firſt from the Cenſures of the People. <hi>Veteraſinus</hi> anſwering, he ſaw ſome that were made Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that he had fought Prizes with upon the Publick Stage; the Emperor took it, and ſaid nothing. He was not forward to puniſh. If any Praetor had behaved himſelf in ſome things ill, yet he did not turn him out of his Praetorſhip, but ordered him to remit his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs intirely into the Hands of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league. He never in his Judgments favoured the <hi>Exchequer</hi> in a Matter of Gain, when it hath been upon himſelf to give Sentence. He was firm to himſelf, and his purpoſe; and yet his Reſolution was ſet off with Modeſty, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where he was even obliged to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe. After his Brother was returned a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52508:70"/> from <hi>Syria,</hi> the Title of <hi>Pater Patria</hi> was given to them both. For <hi>Marcus</hi> had in his abſence comported himſelf to all the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and all People, well. An Oaken, or which is otherwiſe called a Civick Crown, was equally preſented to them both; and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> deſired that <hi>Marcus</hi> ſhould Triumph with him. He deſired that the Sons of <hi>Marcus</hi> ſhould be alſo called <hi>Caeſars.</hi> But ſuch was the great moderation of <hi>Marcus,</hi> that though he joyned in the Triumph, in Company with him, he relinquiſhed to him intirely (when <hi>Verus</hi> was dead) the Title of the Conquerour of the <hi>Parthians;</hi> and ſtiled himſelf only the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour of the <hi>Germans;</hi> which was a Title he had from a War of his own. So they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Children of <hi>Marcus</hi> of either Sex, in the Triumph with them; even his Virgin-Daughters; and they beheld the Games which were Celebrated upon the occaſion, with their triumphal Habits upon them. Amongſt other remarkable things of the Pity of <hi>Marcus,</hi> it is not fit to forget this; that he ordered Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beds to be ſpread under the Rope-dancers, after an accidental fall of a Boy from the Rope: which is the reaſon that we have a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of hanging a Net under them at this day.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the <hi>Parthian</hi> War was yet on Foot,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>War with the</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comanni.</note> another War kindled with the <hi>Marcomanni</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> which was ſuſpended a good while by the Art of the Officers upon the Frontiers, that it ſhould not trouble us till the <hi>Oriental</hi> War was over. It was five years from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Now the terrour of this <hi>Marcomannick</hi> War was ſo great, that <hi>Marcus</hi> was obliged to ſend for Prieſts from all parts, to diſpatch the vaſt number of Sacrifices, which were vowed and offered upon this occaſion. He Celebrated all the Sacred Foreign Rites that were ever ſeen at <hi>Rome;</hi> and purged the City of <hi>Rome</hi> all manner of ways; and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Feaſts of <hi>Lectiſternia</hi> ſeven days together. A Peſtilence at the ſame time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,<note place="margin">A great Plague.</note> which was ſo great, that the dead were carried off in Carts and Wagons. This obliged the two Princes to make ſtrict Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Burials and Sepulchres: in which they provided, that it ſhould not be at the Liberty of Perſons to build their Sepulchres in what place they pleaſed; which is ſtill in force at this day. Many thouſands dyed of this Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; ſeveral of the Nobility: whereof the moſt conſiderable had their Statues ſet up by <hi>Marcus Antoninus.</hi> Who in his great Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency took that care of the Common People, that he ordered them to be buried upon his own Expence. The <hi>Marcomanni</hi> and their Confederates being now actually in Arms, and putting all things into Confuſion, the two Emperours, arrayed in their Military Apparel, ſet forward together upon the Expedition. Their March had no ſmall effect with it, as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52508:71"/> ſoon as they came, but as far as to <hi>Aquileia.</hi> For the Kings of the Enemy for the moſt part not only retreated with their Men, but put to death the Authors of their Inſurrection. The <hi>Quadi,</hi> whoſe King was dead, ſaid that they would not confirm the Perſon his Succeſſour, who had been Created in his place, till our Emperours approved him: others ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to them to ask their Pardon for their diſobedience: ſo that <hi>Verus</hi> his Opinion, who had ſet out much againſt his will in the beginning, was for returning back to <hi>Rome:</hi> eſpecially having loſt the Captain of the Guards, <hi>Furius Victorinus,</hi> and a part of the Army. But <hi>Marcus</hi> believing that the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians diſſembled, and that both their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and the other things which they did, were only out of a fear of being oppreſſed with the weight of ſo great a Force, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf to be for purſuing the War. Therefore they marched on, and croſſed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> having ſettled all things in order, for the ſafety of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Illyricum.</hi> However <hi>Verus</hi> was urgent for going back to <hi>Rome:</hi> to which <hi>Marcus</hi> at laſt conſented, and that the Senate ſhould have notice given them of it by Letter. But as they were afterwards upon the Road in the Coach together <hi>Verus</hi> was<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcus</hi> was ſo little affected for his part with thoſe Pleaſures, which were the real Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Verus</hi> his deſire to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he both Read, and hearkned to any one's Buſineſs, and ſigned Orders whilſt he hath

But yet <hi>Marcus</hi> diſſembled, and even excuſed the Faults of <hi>Verus,</hi> tho' they diſpleaſed him never ſo much. He deified him after his Death. He provided honourably for his Aunts and his Siſters. He appointed a great many Sacrifices to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. He appointed his Prieſts, and gave him all the other Reſpects which are paid to the Gods. But as there is no Prince but is ſubject to the moſt outragious Cenſure; <hi>Marcus</hi> was for all this repreſented, as if he had either poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned <hi>Verus</hi> by a Knife invenom'd on one ſide, with which he cut a piece of a Sacrifice, and gave <hi>Verus</hi> the invenomed part to eat, whilſt he reſerved the ſound to himſelf, or at leaſt, that he killed him by his Phyſician <hi>Poſidip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52508:72"/> eaſie, and more abundant in good Actions than he could be before, becauſe he was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with the Errours of his Brother. He was one for his own Part, of that Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mind, that he never changed his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance either with Sorrow or Joy; following exactly the Precepts of the <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophy, which he had learnt from all the beſt Maſters, and which he had diligently collected from all Parts. <hi>Hadrian</hi> would have made him his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Succeſſour, had not his Minority the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52508:72"/> made an Auction in the <hi>Forum</hi> of <hi>Trajan</hi> of the Goods of his Houſhold. He ſold the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Gold, Cryſtal and Myrrh, the Royal Services, Rich Garments of his Wife's which were embroidered with Gold, and ſeveral Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels which were laid up in the Cabinet of <hi>Hadrian.</hi> The Sale continued Two Months, and ſuch a conſiderable Sum was produced by it, that having proſecuted the Reliques of the <hi>Marcomannick</hi> War with it, according to his deſire, he gave the Buyers the Liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn if they pleaſed their Purchaſes, and take their Money again. But whether they did or no, he was ſatisfied, and allowed Gentlemen to have their Tables as ſplendid as himſelf.

                     <p>Having therefore Reigned to the general Love of all the People, who called him by the endearing Terms of, ſometimes their Brother, ſometimes Father, ſometimes Son, as every one's Age was, he died in the Eighteenth Year<note place="margin">

This great Man, who was ſo Excellent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo ally'd to the Gods, both in his Life and Death, left a Son, <hi>Commodus,</hi> who was ſo ill on the other hand, that it had been happy he had never had him. Nay, it was a ſmall thing, that Perſons of all Ages, Sexes, Conditions and Dignities, honoured <hi>Marcus</hi> as a God; for he was judged Sacrilegious, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had not his Image in his Houſe, if his fortune permitted him. To this day in many Families, the Statues of <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> ſtand, amongſt the Houſhold Deities; and ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have firmly and publickly averred, that he hath predicted many future and true thing to them in Dreams.

                     <p>Some ſay, and it is not unlikely, that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus Antoninus</hi> his Succeſſor and his Son, was a ſort of an Adulterous Birth, the Story where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is repreſented commonly thus. <hi>Fauſtina</hi>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52508:73"/> This was done, and her Love cured. But <hi>Commodus</hi> was born after it, more a Gladiator than a Prince; becauſe when he was Emperor, he fought almoſt a Thouſand Combats with the Gladiators, in the publick view of the People, as we ſhall have occaſion to ſay in his Life. And that which makes this Story the more credible, is, this Son of ſo Holy a Father, was a Man of thoſe profligate Manners, that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sword-player, Actor, Baiter of Beaſts, nor in fine, no one, tho' of the ſink of all Shame and Wickedneſs, was like him. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, that he was abſolutely a Baſtard; and that <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> when ſhe was at the Port of <hi>Gajetta,</hi> choſe herſelf there by the Eye, the Seamen generally working naked, what Men ſhe ſaw were the beſt provided, both out of the Sea-men and the Gladiators; wherefore <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antoninus</hi> was adviſed by one, if he would not puniſh her by Death, to divorce her.

And ſo it was with <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> who perſevering ſtill in his own virtuous way, and not changing in any thing upon the whiſpers or calumnies of the People, neither his Gladiator-Son was a prejudice to him, nor his impure Conſort.

But he died as he was making his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52508:78"/> preparations for that Conqueſt. Two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, his Officers being admitted into his Chamber, he gave them to underſtand that he had as ill an Opinion of his Son <hi>Commodus,</hi> as <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> had a good Opinion of his Son <hi>Alexander;</hi> ſaying, as <hi>Philip</hi> did, he was not ſorry to dye, ſince he left behind him ſuch a Son; but meaning that the <hi>Roman Empire would ſcarce be large enough to hold the Vices of him;</hi> who made it appear already, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Rules of Life, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had preſcribed him, that he was Cruel,<note place="margin">

His death was thus: when he began to be ſick, he called his Son to him, and adviſed him firſt of all not to <hi>ſlight the Reliques of the War, for fear that he ſhould ſeem to betray the Empire.</hi> To which <hi>Commodus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, that he ſhould be obliged for his own ſafety to be gone from the Army, becauſe of the Peſtilence which raged: he told him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>He might do as he would; but he deſired him rather to tarry, at leaſt a few days, becauſe he would do well to appear to hold it a little againſt the Barbarians:</hi> After this, he would neither eat nor drink, becauſe he deſired to dye, and this increaſed his Diſtemper. The ſixth day he called in his Friends, and diſcourſing to them about the Vanity of Humane things, and the Contempt of death, he ſaid, <hi>Why are you ſorry for me, when you ought rather to think of the Peſtilence which rages, and of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon death of every one? As they retired from him,</hi> he ſighed and ſaid, <hi>If you ſee me no more, I bid you farewel; I go before you.</hi> They asked
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52508:79"/> him to whom he recommended his Son. He ſaid; <hi>To all you, if he deſerves it, and to the Gods Immortal.</hi> The Army upon the notice of his ſickneſs was very much troubled; for they loved him dearly. The ſeventh Day he was worſe, and ſaw none but his Son: whom he preſently diſmiſſed again, for fear he ſhould be infected. His Son being gone, he threw the Cloaths over his Head, as if he went to ſleep; and died that night. Some ſay, that when he ſaw that <hi>Commodus</hi> would prove ſuch a Man, as afterwards he did, he rather wiſhed him dead, than that he ſhould make another <hi>Nero, Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Domitian,</hi> by his Reign.</p>
                     <p>One thing <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> is blamed for, which is, That he promoted to ſeveral Honors <hi>Tertullus, Utilius, Orphitus,</hi> and <hi>Moderatus,</hi> who were his Wife's great Lovers. He had<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of</hi> Fauſtina.</note> ſurprized <hi>Tertullus</hi> one day actually at Dinner with her. The Buffoon upon the Stage gave him a Rub as to this Man, in his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <q>What, ſays he to him that was with him, is the name of that Man, that you ſay Gallants my Wife; the other anſwered, <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Tullus, Tullus.</hi> He asked him the ſame Queſtion again: ſays the other, I have told you.</q> By which the Audience plainly ſaw, that he meant, that his crying three times <hi>Tullus,</hi> ſignified <hi>Tertullus.</hi> So every body talk'd very much of this Spark, and blamed the Patience of <hi>Antoninus.</hi> Sometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, and before he went the ſecond time to the <hi>Marcomannick</hi> War, he took his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52508:79"/> Oath in the Capitol, that not one ſingle Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour by his knowledge, had been put to death. And he ſaid, <hi>He ſhould have ſaved the lives even of the Rebels with</hi> Caſſius, <hi>if it had been left to him.</hi> He was ſo far from ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enrich himſelf with the Eſtate of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Perſons, that he abhorred and ſhun'd nothing more than the ſcandal of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: againſt which he purges himſelf in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters. Some pretend to ſay that he was a Diſſembler and not really of that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity as he ſeemed to be, or as either <hi>Pius</hi> or <hi>Verus</hi> was of. And again they ſay, that he too much raiſed the Pride of the Court, by eſtranging his Friends from his Company and his Banquets. He ordered a Deification for his Parents, and honoured the Friends of his Relations with Statues, though they were Perſons that were dead. He did not eaſily believe things upon Truſt; but gave himſelf always time enough to find out the truth. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Fauſtina, Fabia</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Verus</hi> was Ambitious to Marry him. But he rather choſe to content himſelf with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, of a Daughter of a Servant to his late Wife, than over ſo many Children, which he had, to ſuperinduce a Step mother.</p>

                     <p>I Know very well, that ſeveral Perſons who have written the Hiſtory of the Actions of <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Verus,</hi> have done it in ſuch a method, as to give the Reader an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Verus</hi> in the firſt place; following the order not of their Reigns, but their Deaths.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52508:80"/> But I have thought it my Duty to give the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence, as to this, to <hi>Marcus,</hi> and to treat of <hi>Verus</hi> afterwards; becauſe <hi>Marcus</hi> was the firſt of the two upon the Throne; and becauſe his ſurvival after the death of <hi>Verus</hi> made but a continuation ſtill of the ſame Reign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucius Cejonius Aelius Commodus Verus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi> who by his Adoption into the <hi>Aelian</hi> Family by the Will of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> was called <hi>Aelius,</hi> and by his Alliance with <hi>Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> received the name of <hi>Verus Antoninus,</hi> was a Prince, whom we do not reckon in the number of the Beſt, nor yet on the contrary in the number of the Worſt Princes. For as his Virtues were not abundant, ſo neither were his Vices formidable. One thing is, he did not Reign an Independent Monarch of himſelf; for he was under <hi>Marcus;</hi> but yet of an equal Majeſty with him in the Empire; and at the ſame time he very much differed from him in this, that he was Licentious in his Manners; and was of an humour that was frank and open, and could diſſemble nothing. His Father was <hi>Lucius Aelius Verus,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had been Adopted by <hi>Hadrian,</hi> being the firſt of the Title of a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as it is uſed to denote the Perſon appointed to be the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour to the Empire; and who died in that Quality. His Grandfathers, and Great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, together with many of his other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours,<note place="margin">Verus <hi>his Birth and Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                        </note> had been Conſuls. He was born at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Praetorſhip of his Father, upon the eighteenth of the Calends of <hi>January,</hi> which was heretofore alſo the Birth-day of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52508:81"/> Emperor <hi>Nero.</hi> His Family by his Father's ſide was for the moſt part out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> and by his Mother's, out of the City <hi>Faenza.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This being his Extraction, he, upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of his Father by <hi>Hadrian,</hi> came into the Family of that Emperour; continuing wherein after his Father's death, when <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> was pleaſed, out of his care for the good of Poſterity, to take <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> to be his Son, and <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> to be his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; he not only obliged at the ſame time the former to Adopt this <hi>Verus,</hi> but to give him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Daughter to Wife: which Daughter was married however to <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> and not to <hi>Verus,</hi> becauſe <hi>Verus</hi> in reſpect of his Age was not then judged proper for her, (as we have ſaid above,) and <hi>Verus</hi> married <hi>Lucilla,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Marcus.</hi> He was brought up in the Court. His Maſter in Grammar,<note place="margin">His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors.</note> for the Latin, was <hi>Scaurinus,</hi> the Son of that <hi>Scaurus,</hi> who was the Grammarian to <hi>Hadrian:</hi> For the Greek, he had <hi>Telephas, Hephaeſtion,</hi> and <hi>Harpocration.</hi> His Maſters in the Greek Eloquence were <hi>Apollonius, Celer Caninius,</hi> and <hi>Herodes Atticus;</hi> for the Latin, <hi>Cornelius Front<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He pleaſed himſelf the moſt at firſt in making Verſes; and afterwards in making Orations. It is ſaid, he was a better Oratour than a Poet; or rather, to ſpeak more properly, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52508:81"/> he was a worſe Poet than he was an Orator. Others ſay, he had the Wits of his Friends to aſſiſt him; and that in thoſe very things of his which are Extant, whatſoever they are, he ſerved himſelf of the ſame. For, they ſay, he had ſeveral Men of Learning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence always with him. The Governour of his Youth was <hi>Nicomedes.</hi> He was Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous; and ſhew'd great gaiety in all ſorts of Pleaſures, Sports and Divertiſements, which became him but too well. He was Adopted at the Age of ſeven years, and was formed upon the Manners and Authority of <hi>Marcus Antoninus.</hi> He loved Hunting, Wreſtling, and all the Exerciſes of Youth; and was as a private Perſon in the Court no leſs than three and twenty years together.</p>

He much delighted in the Races of the Cirque, and in the Games of the Gladiatours; but as his Pleaſures and his Luxury were continually the occaſions of his falling into many errours; it ſeems, as if he was not retained in the Royal Family by <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> but upon this account; becauſe <hi>Hadrian</hi> had commanded him to Adopt him ſo expreſly, that he call'd him his own Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and ſo he retained him, it is ſuppoſed, more to diſcharge his Truſt, than as a mark of his Love.

In like manner, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his return out of <hi>Syria</hi> he made a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Tavern of the Court; where after having dined with <hi>Marcus,</hi> he retired to his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and diverted himſelf with all ſorts of filthy Perſons.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52508:83"/> digeſtion. In the mean time <hi>Marcus</hi> diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all theſe things, as if he knew nothing of them, out of Modeſty, not to put to ſhame his Brother.</p>
                     <p>One Banquet, that he made, is remarkable: he had in the firſt place twelve Gueſts; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the known Proverb, as to the number at ſuch a time, is, <hi>Septem convivium, novem convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium;</hi> that is, <hi>Seven's a Company, Nine is but Noiſe.</hi> Every one of theſe had a handſome Boy at his Back to ſerve him. Every one his Sewer, and his Diſhes to himſelf, which were of their own chuſing. Every one his freſh Cup of Myrrh, or of the Cryſtal of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> as oft as he drank. There were alſo Cups of Gold and Silver, and others ſet with Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. Then they had Crowns upon their Heads, adorned with golden Labels, and Flowers, ſuch as for the Seaſon were Rarities. They had their golden Boxes filled with pretious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and at parting they all had their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſhes drawn with Mules in Harneſs of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, preſented to them, to carry them home. The whole Treat was eſtimated at ſixty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Seſterces: which when <hi>Marcus</hi> heard of, he ſighed, and lamented the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of the Publick in the Perſon of his Brother. After Supper they played at Dice all that night, till it was morning. And this he did after his return from the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, to which <hi>Marcus</hi> had ſent him purpoſely, that he ſhould not commit thoſe ſort of Actions in the ſight of all the World at <hi>Rome;</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides that Travelling might teach him
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52508:83"/> frugality, and the dangers of War make him better, and more ſober, or at leaſt teach him to know himſelf to be an Emperour: but how much the better he was for it, this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per alone ſhews, as well as the reſt of his Life.</p>
                     <p>His love of the Races of the Cirque was ſuch, that he ſent and received many Letters about them, into, and out of the Provinces. When preſent at them, and in Company with <hi>Marcus,</hi> he has ſuffered ſeveral Affronts from the contrary Party, for his over great Zeal to that to which he ſided. He had a Horſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Swift, whoſe Image he cut out in Gold, and fed him with Raiſins and Almonds, in the Manger, inſtead of Corn; covered him with a Cloath of Purple, and ordered him to be kept in a Room in the Court. When this Horſe died, he Erected a Monument to him upon the <hi>Vatican.</hi> And it was firſt in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of this Horſe, that they began the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of gathering Money for the Winning Horſes, in the way, as it were, of a Praemium. For this Horſe was ſo much beloved; that a Buſhel of pieces of Gold hath often been thrown to him by thoſe of his Side in the Cirque.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Verus</hi> ſet forward upon his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition<note place="margin">His negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</note> to the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, <hi>Marcus</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him as far as to <hi>Capua.</hi> But going on his way from <hi>Capua,</hi> he Revelled it ſo, at all the great Houſes where he came, that he contracted an Illneſs, and fell Sick at <hi>Canoſa</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> whither <hi>Marcus</hi> took a ſecond Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to viſit him there. Certainly many ill
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52508:84"/> and unhandſome things appear in the Conduct of <hi>Verus,</hi> which he did during the time of the War. For when both the Lieutenant of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was killed, and the Legions there were cut off; the <hi>Syrians</hi> Meditating a Revolt, and the Eaſt laid Waſte by the Enemy, then was he paſſing his time in Hunting in <hi>Apuleia.</hi> At <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> he had his Muſical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, and Entertainments of Voices and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. At every Port of note in <hi>Aſia, Pamphylia,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where he came, he made a ſtay to take his Pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>After he was come to <hi>Antioch,</hi> he followed his Luxuries to exceſs for his own part, whilſt his Generals carried on the <hi>Parthian</hi> War; who were <hi>Statius Priſcus, Avidius Caſſius,</hi> and <hi>Martius Verus.</hi> In four years they went through <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Media,</hi> and recovered <hi>Armenia:</hi> which procured to him the honourable Title of Conquerour of the <hi>Armenians, Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> which was alſo Communicated to <hi>Marcus</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> He paſſed the Winters in thoſe four years, at the City of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> the Summers at the Village of <hi>Daphne,</hi> and the reſt of the time at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi> All the <hi>Syrians</hi> made a jeſt of him; and ſeveral Railleries, which they paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him upon the Stage in their Plays, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. He admitted his Slaves to be as free with him at all times, as the Cuſtom is to be upon the Feaſts of <hi>Saturn.</hi> He went, at the ſolicitation of his Courtiers, as far as to the Banks of the <hi>Euphrates</hi> twice; and he came up to <hi>Epheſus</hi> to meet his Wife <hi>Lucilla,</hi> who was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52508:84"/> ſent to him from <hi>Marcus</hi> her Father. But his deſign in this laſt Journey principally was to prevent <hi>Marcus,</hi> that he ſhould not come down with her into <hi>Syria,</hi> and ſo detect his ill deportments: becauſe <hi>Marcus</hi> had told the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that he would bear his Daughter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany into <hi>Syria.</hi> At laſt, when the War was ended, he appointed Kings over the reſpective Kingdoms, and gave the Governments of the Provinces amongſt his Officers: and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned<note place="margin">
                           <hi>His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to</hi> Rome.</note> himſelf to <hi>Rome,</hi> but much againſt his inclination, though it was to take the honour of a Triumph; becauſe to leave <hi>Syria,</hi> was to leave, as it were, his own Proper Kingdom. So he came and triumphed in Company with his Brother, and the Senate conſirmed the Titles to him, which he had before received from the Army.</p>
                     <p>He ſhaved his Beard (which he had not done before) in <hi>Syria,</hi> only to pleaſure an ordinary Miſtreſs, that he had gained there; which gave the <hi>Syrians</hi> an occaſion to ſay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things upon him. The time of his return to <hi>Rome</hi> was unfortunate: for it ſeemed, as if he brought the Plague with him thither, and into the Provinces through which he paſſed. This Plague aroſe firſt in the Country of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> where out of a ſmall golden Coffer, which a Soldier had plundered in the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> proceeded, it is ſaid, ſuch a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentious ſtench, as ſpread itſelf from thence into <hi>Parthia,</hi> and ſo over the World. Not that this was yet a fault of <hi>Verus,</hi> but of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius;</hi> who, contrary to his Faith given, raſed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52508:85"/> the City of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> after it had received our Forces, as Friends. At the ſame time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, <hi>Quadratus,</hi> a Writer of the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, Vindicates <hi>Caſſius</hi> too againſt this accuſation; and lays the blame upon the <hi>Seleucians</hi> themſelves, for breaking their Faith with <hi>Caſſius</hi> the firſt. But however that is, <hi>Verus</hi> had ſo much reverence for <hi>Marcus,</hi> that he deſired to Communicate to him, upon the day that they triumphed together, the ſame Titles and Names of Honour which had been deferred to himſelf. But yet, after his return from the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, he was not altogether ſo very obſervant of <hi>Marcus</hi> as formerly, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his Servants to have too great an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over him, and acting in many things by them, without the advice of his Brother. To which it is to be added, that he brought a<note place="margin">His other Vanities.</note> Company of Mimicks with him out of <hi>Syria,</hi> as if they had been ſo many Kings to adorn his Triumph. The principal of whom called by the name of <hi>Paris.</hi> Then he built himſelf a famous Seat upon the <hi>Via Clodia;</hi> where he Revelled with great Luxury for ſeveral days together in Company with his Servants, and ſuch of his choſen Friends, whoſe preſence brought no conſtraint upon him. He invited <hi>Marcus</hi> thither one day to ſee him; who came, but it was to ſhew to him the ſanctity of his life, which was great and worthy to have been the ſubject of his imitation. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> tarried with him five days; but employed his time all the while in continual Buſineſs,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52508:85"/> whilſt <hi>Verus</hi> was either Feaſting, or providing for his Feaſts. Another Mimick that he brought with him out of <hi>Syria,</hi> as a Trophy of the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, was one, that he called by the Name of <hi>Apolauſtus;</hi> but his former Name was <hi>Agrippus Memphis.</hi> He brought with him beſides, for his diverſion, Fidlers, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Players, Buffoons, Juglers, and of all thoſe ſorts of Slaves which <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> are ſo delighted with; that really one would think by his Captives, that he had been making War, not againſt <hi>Parthia,</hi> but againſt the Stage.</p>
                     <p>It was not openly viſible to the World, but yet it was privately whiſpered, that this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his Life to that of <hi>Marcus,</hi> with many other things, occaſioned an ill Underſtanding betwixt them. Eſpecially, this was ſaid upon the Death of <hi>Libo,</hi> who was a Couſin German to <hi>Marcus,</hi> and who had been ſent by him, as his Lieutenant into <hi>Syria;</hi> where behaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more haughtily than a Senatour in that Quality ought to have done, and ſaying, <hi>That be would write to</hi> Marcus <hi>to be ſatisfied, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he doubted in any thing; Verus</hi> could not take it, that he paid no more Reſpect to him, who was an Emperor upon the Place; and after this <hi>Libo</hi> died ſuddenly, with almoſt the Marks of Poyſon upon him. From which ſome thought, that he was poyſoned by the hand of <hi>Verus.</hi> And though <hi>Marcus</hi> was not of this Opinion, yet the thing ſerved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the rumor of their diſagreement. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minas</hi> and <hi>Agaclytus,</hi> two Servants of <hi>Verus,</hi> had
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52508:86"/> a great Influence over him, as I have already ſaid in the Life of <hi>Marcus.</hi> He married the latter to <hi>Libo</hi>'s Widow, although contrary to the deſire of <hi>Marcus,</hi> who therefore denied his Preſence to the Eſpouſals. <hi>Codes,</hi> and <hi>Aelius Laetus</hi> or <hi>Electus,</hi> were two others of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numitted Servants: He had more beſides, who were all ill Men enough, and whom <hi>Marcus</hi> diſmiſſed, after the Death of their Maſter; only <hi>Aelius Laetus</hi> he retained, who afterwards was the Author of the Death of his Son <hi>Commodus.</hi> In fine, when the <hi>German</hi> War<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</hi>
                        </note> came on, becauſe <hi>Marcus</hi> neither thought fit to ſend <hi>Verus</hi> to it alone, nor yet to leave him in the Town alone, upon the Account of his great Luxury, they went both together to it, and came to the City of <hi>Aquileia;</hi> where <hi>Verus</hi> did nothing but divert and enjoy himſelf, whilſt <hi>Marcus</hi> took upon him the Care of all things. They croſſed the <hi>Alps,</hi> although this was much againſt the Inclination of <hi>Verus;</hi> and as for what paſſed afterwards betwixt the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> on the one hand, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Peace, and our Emperors on the other, it hath been already repreſented ſufficiently in the Life of <hi>Marcus.</hi> So the heat of the War being over, and <hi>Verus</hi> urging to return to <hi>Aquileia</hi> again, becauſe he longed for the Pleaſures of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was reſolved by both to go back to <hi>Rome.</hi> But as <hi>Verus</hi> was in the Coach, not far from the City of <hi>Altino,</hi> he was taken ſuddenly with an Apoplexy; for which, lifting him immediately out of the Coach, and letting him Blood, they brought
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52508:86"/> him alive unto <hi>Altino,</hi> where he continued three Days ſpeechleſs, and then died.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Death of</hi> Verus.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was a Diſcourſe, as if he had been Inceſtuous with his Wife's Mother, <hi>Fauſtina;</hi> and that <hi>Fauſtina</hi> had contrived his Death, by putting Poyſon in his Oyſters, becauſe the Converſation which he had with the Mother, he diſcovered to the Daughter. There was another Story made of his Death, which I have ſet down in the Life of <hi>Marcus,</hi> but which is utterly inconſiſtent with the Virtue of that great Man. Others attributed his Death to his own Wife, becauſe he was a little too indulgent to the Love which he had for <hi>Fabia</hi> his Siſter, whoſe Power ſhe could not brook. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there was that great Kindneſs betwixt <hi>Verus</hi> and <hi>Fabia,</hi> that it was alſo reported, that they two had conſulted together to kill <hi>Marcus;</hi> but when this was diſcovered to <hi>Marcus</hi> by <hi>Agaclytus</hi> the Servant of <hi>Verus, Fauſtina</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Murder of <hi>Marcus,</hi> and ſhe herſelf killed <hi>Verus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to his Perſon, he was well ſhaped, with<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</note> a good Viſage, and a Beard, before he ſhaved, extraordinary long, like a Barbarian; tall, and a frown upon his Brow that was awful. He had yellow Hair, which he took a great Care of, and uſed an Art with Gold Duſt, to make it glitter, and look yellower ſtill. He was a little ſlow in Speech, a great Lover of Game, always Luxurious, and in many things a <hi>Nero,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Cruelty and Buffoonry. Amongſt the reſt of his Curious Furniture for his Luxury, he had a Cryſtal Cup, that he called <hi>Swift,</hi>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52508:87"/> after the Name of his beloved Horſe; and it was of ſo large a ſize, it held a Draught in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more fit for a Horſe, than any thing elſe. He lived Two and Forty Years, and reigned Eleven, in Conjunction with his Brother.</p>
                     <p>His Body was interred in the Sepulchre of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> where his Father the <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo lies. The Story which I now ſaid, is inconſiſtent with the Virtue of <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> is well known, and it is this; That <hi>Marcus</hi> with a Knife empoyſoned on the one ſide of it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Piece of a Sacrifice to <hi>Verus,</hi> and gave that Part thereof to <hi>Verus</hi> to eat, which was touched with the Poyſon; which is a Crime impoſſible to be conceived of <hi>Marcus,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Life and Actions of <hi>Verus</hi> might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps deſerve. Neither do we leave it in doubt, but wholly reject it as a falſe and ſuppoſititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing; being aſſured, that excepting your Majeſty, O <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> as yet, ſince <hi>Marcus,</hi> Flattery it ſelf hath not been able to form a better and a more accompliſhed Prince than he.</p>

                           <p>I <hi>Have read your Letter, in which you are too apprehenſive, than I would have an Emperor to be, or than ſuits well with our Reigns: For if the Empire is allotted to</hi> Avidius Caſſius <hi>by Heaven, we ſhould not be able to cut him off, if we would: You know the ſaying of your Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father</hi> Hadrian, That no Man kills his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour. <hi>But if it is not ſo allotted him, he will fall of himſelf into the fatal Snare, without our Cruelty.

                     <p>This is what <hi>Verus</hi> and what <hi>Marcus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi> ſeverally wrote concerning <hi>Caſſius.</hi> Now we ſhall explain in ſhort the Temper and the Manners of this Perſon; which is all that can well be known of ſuch, whoſe Lives, no one preſumes to write to their Advantage, out of Reſpect to thoſe by whom they were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; only we ſhall add ſomething of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Empire, and of his Death. Having in this Deſign that we are upon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ourſelves to take in the Hiſtories of all that in any wiſe have born the Title of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, whether juſtly or unjuſtly, to the end that your Majeſty, O <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> ſhould have a perfect Account before you, to your own Perſon, of the Events of the Empire of <hi>Rome.</hi> He was a Man of that Variety in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that now he was cruel and ill humored, then mild and obliging; now he was very Religious, then Profane; ſometimes he drank hard, then he was as abſtemious; ſometimes he eat very much, another time he faſted as
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52508:89"/> much; ſometimes he was all for Women, then he was all for Chaſtity; ſo that People were not wanting to call him a <hi>Catiline;</hi> and he ſaid, they might call him what they pleaſed, ſo he but gained his Point of the <hi>Dialogiſt;</hi> by which Name he meant <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> who was ſo eminently skill'd in Philoſophy, that going to the War againſt the <hi>Marcomanni;</hi> and every body being in fear for him, leſt any thing ill ſhould happen to him, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him before he went, that he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to them his Precepts of Philoſophy; which at their Entreaty he did, in Diſcourſes to them, which he continued three Days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                     <p>Now having begun to make mention of his<note place="margin">His ſtrict Diſcipline</note> Strictneſs, there are many Inſtances not to be omitted, in which he ſhew'd himſelf not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to ſay ſtrict, as he was cruel. For firſt, if the Soldiers had taken but the leaſt thing by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from the People of the Provinces, he crucified them immediately upon the place, where they committed the Fact. He had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way of executing them, which was purely of his own Invention, which was this. A great Stake of Timber was ſet up, which was Eighty, or a Hundred Foot high; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned were tied to this Stake in Ranks, from the top to the bottom; at the bottom was a Fire, which burnt ſome to Death, whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were ſuffocated with the Smoak, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52508:90"/> others were ſometimes frightned to Death. He hath ordered Ten in a Body to be chain'd, and thrown into a River, or into the Sea to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. To Deſerters, he many times cut off their Hands, or their Legs and Thighs; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The Example of a Criminal living in that manner in miſery, is of a greater Force, than if he was kill'd at a blow.</hi> A Party of the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries, once in the Army under his Command, had without his knowledge ſurpriſed the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matae,</hi> as they were lying careleſly upon the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> of whom they killed Three Thouſand, and returned to their Corps again, with a great Booty. And as it was their Centurions that had put them upon this Action, the Centurions expected to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for it; becauſe with a handful of Men they had killed ſuch a Number of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whilſt the Tribunes and the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers had neglected the Opportunity that was offered. But for their Reward, he ordered them to be all taken, and, which is a thing without Example, crucified like Slaves. He ſaid, <hi>It might have happened, that the Enemy had had a Trick in it, and an Ambuſcade, which would have much reflected upon the Honour of the</hi> Roman <hi>Name.</hi> So a great Mutiny upon this ariſing in the Army, he came immediately to them, and ſaid, <hi>Kill me, if you think fit, and add that Fact more to this Corruption of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> At which they were all appeaſed. He ſhew'd he did not fear them; and this made him to be feared by them: Which added ſuch Strength to the Diſcipline of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52508:90"/> ſtruck ſuch a Regard on the other ſide into the Enemy, that they came and begged of the Emperor <hi>Antoninus</hi> an Hundred Years Peace, having had the Satisfaction to ſee thoſe very Perſons who had gotten a Victory over them, condemned to Death, by the Judgment of the <hi>Roman</hi> General himſelf; becauſe without his permiſſion, they had without Orders gained that Victory.</p>
                     <p>Many more of his Severities upon the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are to be ſeen in <hi>Aemilius Parthenianus;</hi> he cauſed them to be beaten with Rods in the Markets, and in the midſt of the Camp; he cut off their Heads, or many times their Hands. He forbad them to carry any thing with them in an Expedition, beſide Bacon, Bisket, and Vinegar; which if he found they tranſgreſſed, he not a little puniſhed their Luxury.</p>

Then as Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he choſe himſelf a Captain of the Guards, and made one of his Sons Governour of the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which Two were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards both kill'd by the Army, but it was done againſt the Will, and without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Marcus Antoninus;</hi> who neither fell into any Paſſion to hear of the News of the Rebellion, nor ſought his Revenge upon the Children or Friends of <hi>Caſſius.</hi> The Senate declared him an Enemy, and confiſcated his Eſtate, which <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> forbidding to be returned into his proper Coffers, it was paid by the Order of the Senate into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſury.

Antoninus</hi> anſwered, <hi>We have not ſo ſerved the Gods, nor ſo lived, as that it ſhould be his luck to Conquer us.</hi> Upon which he reckoned up all the Princes that had been killed, and ſaid, <hi>That there were Reaſons for which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it; for ſcarce ever any good Prince had been either killed or conquered by an Uſurper; for</hi> Nero <hi>deſerved it;</hi> Caligula <hi>deſerved it;</hi> Otho <hi>and</hi> Vitellius <hi>were not fit to reign. He thought as much of</hi> Galba <hi>for his Covetouſneſs,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>That Avarice in an Emperor is a moſt bitter Fault. In fine, not</hi> Auguſtus Caeſar, <hi>nor</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan, <hi>nor</hi> Hadrian, <hi>nor</hi> Antoninus Pius <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could ever be ſurmounted by the Rebols, tho' they had many of them; but it was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52508:93"/> Fate to be deſtroyed, ſometime even without the Knowledge, and contrary to the Will of thoſe Princes.</hi> So he deſired the Senate not to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert too ſeverely upon the Accomplices of the defection of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> wiſhing that no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour might be put to Death in his Reign; which gained him an extraordinary deal of Love. Some few Centurions were puniſhed, and then as for others who were baniſhed, he ordered them to be re-called and pardoned them.</p>
                     <p>He pardoned the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> who had ſo firmly adhered to the Uſurpation of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> together with other Cities that had aſſiſted him. For tho' at the firſt he was very angry at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſo as to take away their publick Games, and many other Ornaments of their City, yet he afterward reſtored them to them again. He beſtowed a Moiety of the Eſtate of <hi>Caſſius</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Sons, and gave his Daughters the Gold, Silver; and Jewels. <hi>Alexandra,</hi> who was one of them, and <hi>Druentianus</hi> her Husband, had free Power from him to go whither they would, and lived in the greateſt Security, not like the Pledges of an Uſurper, but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of a Senatour.

                        <hi>You, it is true, my</hi> Fauſtina, <hi>Adviſe very well in your love to your Husband and Children. I have Read your Letter, in which you deſire me to proſecute the Accomplices of</hi> Caſſius. <hi>But yet I ſhall ſpare his Children, Son in-Law, and Wife, and write to the Senate to be Favourable
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52508:94"/> to all the Party. For there is not any thing that more recommends a</hi> Roman <hi>Emperour to all the World, than Clemency. This made</hi> Caeſar <hi>a God. This Conſecrated</hi> Auguſtus. <hi>This particularly adorned your Father with the Title of</hi> Pious. <hi>In a word, if they had gone according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Advice upon the War, not ſo much as</hi> Caſſius <hi>ſhould have been killed. So be then ſatisfied. The Gods protect me: my Piety is pleaſing to the Gods. I have declared our</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peianus, <hi>Conſul for the next year.</hi> This is what <hi>Antoninus</hi> writ to his Wife.</p>
                     <p>Now let us ſee what an Oration, upon this occaſion, he ſent to the Senate. A part of it is thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fathers of the Senate; you have now my Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Law to be your Conſul: I ſay,</hi> Pompeianus; <hi>whoſe Age had long ago been rewarded with that Office, but that other extraordinary Men have intervened, to whom it was juſt to pay the Honour, that the State hath owed them. Now as for what concerns the Defection of</hi> Caſſius, <hi>I beg and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you Fathers of the Senate, that you would continue to me, nay to your ſelves, the Character of Piety and Clemency, and let the Senate put none to death. Let not one member of the Senate be put to death, nor the blood be ſpilt of any one that is Noble. Let the baniſhed return, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed receive their Eſtates.

                           </gap> let it be never ſo juſt. You will give a Pardon therefore to the Children of</hi> Avidius Caſſius, <hi>his Son-in-Law, and his Wife. But why do I ſay
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52508:95"/> Pardon, when they have committed nothing? Let them live in ſafety, knowing that they live under the Reign of</hi> Marcus Antoninus. <hi>Let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Patrimony of their Parents, which hath in part been already granted to them. Let them have the Gold, the Silver, and the Wardrobe. Let them be rich. Let them be ſafe. Let them have their full Liberty, and in the ſight of all People. Let them be as ſo many inſtances of mine, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of your Clemency. Nor is this ſuch a great Grace, Fathers of the Senate, to grant a Pardon to the Wives and Children of perſons Proſcribed. I do further deſire of you, that ſuch of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorian, and Equeſtrian Orders, as have been Accomplices in this Defection, be Protected alſo by your Authority from Murder, from Proſcription, from Fear, from Infamy, from Envy, and from all kind of Injury; and that you allow this Honour to my Reign, that none upon theſe accounts are killed in it, but who only in the very Tumults are killed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This great Clemency of his was followed by the Senate, with theſe Acclamations. <hi>The Gods preſerve</hi> Antoninus <hi>the</hi> Pious, <hi>the Gods ſave</hi> Antoninus <hi>the</hi> Merciful. O Antoninus <hi>the</hi> Merciful! <hi>the Gods ſave you. Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty hath refuſed to do what you very well might have done: we have done but what became us. Make</hi> Commodus, <hi>your Son, Emperor with you Strengthen your Race. See that your Children are ſafe. No Force can touch a good Reign. We beg the Tribunitian Power for</hi> Commodus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus. <hi>We beg the Preſence of your Majeſty with us. We Congratulate you for your Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52508:95"/> your Patience, your Learning, your Nobility, your Innocence. You conquen your Foes. You ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount your Enemies. The Gods ſave you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the Poſterity of <hi>Avidius Caſſius</hi> lived in Safety, and were admitted unto Honours, till <hi>Commodus Antoninus</hi> ſucceeded after the Death of his Father, and then commanded them all to be burnt alive, as much as if he had ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them in the very Act of ſome Treaſon.</p>
                     <p>This then is what we have found concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Avidius Caſſius,</hi> who in his Temper was always various, but more eſpecially propenſe to Correction and Cruelty: But yet if he had carried the Empire, he would have been flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Name of not only of a Gracious, but an Uſeful, and an Excellent Prince.</p>

                           <head>A Letter to his Son-in-Law, which he writ in the time, that he acted the Emperor, is in part as follows.</head>
                           <p>
                              <hi>UNhappy State! How miſerably does it ſuffer under the Power of the Rich, and Men thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſo?</hi> Marcus <hi>is an excellent Perſon truly; who to get himſelf the Title of Merciful, ſuffers thoſe to live, whoſe Lives he condemns at the ſame time! Where is now that</hi> Lucius Caſſius, <hi>whoſe Name I bear, tho' I am unworthy of it? Where is that</hi> Marcus Cato, <hi>the Cenſor? Where is all the Diſcipline of our Fore fathers, which decayed long ago, but now is not ſo much as asked for?</hi> Marcus Antoninus <hi>Philoſophiſes, and Diſputes about Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52508:96"/> and the Soul, to Juſtice and Honeſty; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinks of the State. You ſee there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For my part, I wiſh to thoſe Preſidents of the provinces, all the Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they deſerve. What can I think them Proconſuls, or think them Preſidents, who live, as if the Provinces were given them by the Senate, and by</hi> Marcus <hi>the Emperor, only to be Luxurions in, and to get to be Rich? You have heard of the Captain of the Guards to our Philoſopher. He who three Days before was a Beggar, and a poor Rat, is now become a rich Man on a ſudden. From whence, I pray, but out of the Bowels of the State, and the Fortunes of the People of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces? Well, let them be Rich, let them be Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, they will ſo much the more enrich the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Coffers. The Gods favour only an honeſt Cauſe, and the Friends of</hi> Caſſius <hi>ſhall reſtore the Empire.</hi>

                     <head>THE Life and Reign OF THE EMPEROR <hi>Commodus Antoninus,</hi>
                     </head>
                     <byline>BY AELIUS LAMPRIDIUS: Addreſſed to the EMPEROR <hi>DIOCLESIAN.</hi>
                     </byline>
                     <p>AS for what concerns the Family of<note place="margin">His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> 
                        <hi>Commodus Antoninus,</hi> we have ſpoken ſufficiently already upon that Head in the Life of his Father <hi>Marcus.</hi> He was born at <hi>Lavinia,</hi> the Day before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of <hi>September,</hi> under the Conſulſhips of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52508:98"/> his Father and his Uncle. It is ſaid, his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father by his Mother's ſide had been formerly born at the ſame place. When <hi>Fauſtina</hi> was big of him, ſhe dreamt, <hi>She ſhould be brought to Bed of two Serpents, but that one of them was more Fierce than the other.</hi> So ſhe was brought to Bed of <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> at one Birth; the latter died at four Years of Age, and yet the Mathematicians had promiſed him by his Stars, an equal Fortune and Life with <hi>Commodus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> educated <hi>Commodus</hi> as well,<note place="margin">His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors.</note> according to his own Precepts, as to thoſe of the great and the beſt Men. <hi>Oneſicritus</hi> was his Maſter in the Greek; <hi>Capella Antiſtius</hi> in the Latin, and <hi>Atteius Sanctus</hi> in Rhetorick. But as many Maſters as he had in the good Arts, they ſignified nothing to him; whether the Fault was in his natural Genius, or in thoſe who had the Conduct of his Youth at the Court. For from a Boy, he was Naught, Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Cruel, Lewd without Shame; at the ſame time, Excellent at things not belonging to the Quality of an Emperor, as Glaſs-making, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Singing, Playing upon the Pipe; a Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon, and a Gladiator in Perfection. He gave an early mark of his Cruelty at <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> in the Twelfth Year of his Age; when Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and the Water happening, to be a little too hot, he commanded his Servant to take the Man that attended the Bath, and throw him into the Furnace: In whoſe ſtead, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant threw in a Sheep-skin, which he did, to make him believe, that it was indeed the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52508:98"/> Bagnio man, by the filthineſs of the Stench. He had the Title of <hi>Caeſar</hi> given him, when a Boy, together with <hi>Verus,</hi> a Brother of his; and in his Fourteenth Year, he was entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the College of the Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>He was declared <hi>Prince of the</hi> Roman <hi>Youth,</hi> at the ſame time that he put on the Man's, that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Gown; before which, he had already given a Largeſs to the People. He put on that Gown upon the Nones of <hi>July,</hi> the Day that <hi>Romulus</hi> died, and the Year that <hi>Caſſius</hi> revolted from <hi>Marcus Antoninus.</hi> He went with his Father into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and returned with him again back to <hi>Rome.</hi> Then by a Diſpenſation of the Law, as to his Age, he was made Conſul; and upon the Fifth of the Calends of <hi>December,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhips of <hi>Pollio</hi> and <hi>Aper,</hi> he was declared Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror<note place="margin">
                           <hi>He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, A. C.</hi> CLXXXI.</note> in Conjunction with his Father, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed with him; the Senate having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it ſo to his Honour. He went with his Father to the <hi>German</hi> War: But as for ſuch of the Officers of his Court, and of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, as were Perſons of Virtue, he could never endure them. All the worſt ſort of Men he gladly kept in his Service; and if they were removed from him, he was ſick till he had them again. Hence he made a Tavern and<note place="margin">His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</note> a Bawdy houſe continually of the Court, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſparing for Coſt or Modeſty; playing at Dice, and hiring the lewd Women of the Town, which were any thing pretty, to be with him, to make a Sport with in all manner of Debauchery. Sometimes he went about
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52508:99"/> the Markets with ſmall Wares like a Pedlar; ſometimes he was a Horſe-Merchant, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he drove his own Chariots in the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's Cloaths. He eat and drank with Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, pimped to the Whores with Waſhes, and appeared to be born rather for the moſt infamous uſes, than for that Place unto which Fortune raiſed him.</p>
                     <p>He turned off at his coming to the Empire, his Father's old Servants, and his old Friends. And one day he made an attempt upon the Modeſty of a Son of <hi>Salvius Julianus,</hi> who was one of his Commanders. But being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, he ever after ſtuck upon the skirts of his Father. All the beſt ſort of Men about the Court were turned away, either in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or by removing them to other places which were unworthy of them. The Mimicks repreſented him, as a Burdaſh, for which he preſently baniſhed them. He quitted the War which his Father had almoſt finiſhed, and granted to the Enemy every thing that they deſired, and then came to <hi>Rome;</hi> where when he triumphed, he had one <hi>Soaterus</hi> in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot with him at his back, to whom he many times turned about, and kiſſed him publickly; and ſo he did in the Cirque. In the Evenings he gave himſelf the Liberty to run up and down to the Taverns and the Bawdy-houſes; he made Men Governours of the Provinces, who were either the Companions of his Crimes, or recommended by as ill as thoſe that were: which brought him ſo much on the one hand into the hatred, and on the other into the contempt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52508:99"/> of the Senate, that he ſet himſelf in Revenge upon the deſtruction of that great Order.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Cruelty of <hi>Commodus</hi> was a thing that moved <hi>Quadratus</hi> and <hi>Lucilla</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Conſpiracy to kill him, not without the privity of <hi>Tarruntinus Paternus</hi> the Captain of the Guards. The care of giving him the fatal Blow, was committed to <hi>Claudius Pompeia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his Kinſman; who going in to him with a Ponyard, prepared for that purpoſe, as he had his Opportunity to ſtrike, he broke out firſt into theſe Words, <hi>The Senate ſends you this;</hi> whereby detecting his Deſign too ſoon, he<note place="margin">A Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him defeated.</note> failed to accompliſh it, the Company taking the Part of <hi>Commodus.</hi> Upon this in the firſt place, <hi>Pompeianus</hi> and <hi>Quadratus,</hi> were put to Death; then <hi>Norbana,</hi> and <hi>Norbanus,</hi> with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralius</hi> and his Mother; and <hi>Lucilla</hi> was baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Another Reaſon of <hi>Commodus</hi> his falling into ſo great an odium, being upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Saoterus,</hi> whoſe Power the People of <hi>Rome</hi> could not brook; the Captains of the Guards very civilly drew this Man out of the Court, under the colour of going to aſſiſt at ſome Sacrifice, and as he was returning back again, their Spies (that they had ſet) fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and killed him. This was worſe taken by <hi>Commodus,</hi> than the Conſpiracy that had been form'd againſt himſelf; and looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Tarruntinus Paternus</hi> to be the Author of it, as he was, and privy alſo to the intended Aſſaſſination of his own Perſon, he firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved him from his Place and Power of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52508:100"/> of the Guards, by the way of doing him the Honour to make him a Senatour, (becauſe theſe two Places were then inconſiſtent with one another) and in a few days after, he charged him, not only with the ſaid Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, but with promiſing his Daughter in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the Son of <hi>Julianus,</hi> in order as he pretended, that the Empire ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon <hi>Julianus.</hi> So both <hi>Paternus,</hi> and<note place="margin">His cruel Severity.</note> 
                        <hi>Julianus,</hi> and <hi>Vitruvius Secundus,</hi> who was a particular Friend of <hi>Paternus,</hi> and who was one of the Secretaries to <hi>Commodus,</hi> were put to Death. All the Houſe of the <hi>Quintilii</hi> were extinguiſhed, except <hi>Sextus</hi> the Son of <hi>Condia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Quintilius</hi> who paſſed under the notion of being dead. <hi>Vitraſia Fauſtina, Velius Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Egnatius Capito</hi> were put to Death; the latter of which had been a Conſul. The Conſuls <hi>Aemilius Junctus,</hi> and <hi>Attilius Severus</hi> were baniſhed, and many others were ſeverely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in divers ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Commodus</hi> did not ſo eaſily appear after this in Publick, nor ſuffer himſelf to be ſpoken with upon any Buſineſs, but what was firſt referred to <hi>Perennis;</hi> who knowing very we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

Whom he would, he put to Death; others he plundered. He ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted all the Laws, and whatever he took, he put it into his own Pocket. As for <hi>Commodus,</hi> he firſt raviſhed, and then killed his Siſter<note place="margin">His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſts.</note> 
                        <hi>Lucilla.</hi> He violated in like manner the reſt of his own Siſters, and lay with a Couſin-German of his Fathers, and gave the Names of his Mother and of his own Wife to one of his Concubines; which Lady he afterwards taking great with another Man, he turned her off, baniſhed her, and then killed her. Yet he hath other times commanded his own Concubines to be enjoyed by others in his ſight; nor was he without the moſt ſcandalous uſe of Boys. He corrupted himſelf with both the Sexes, in every part of his Body, even to his Mouth. <hi>Claudius Pompeianus,</hi> whoſe Son had gone into the Chamber to him with the Poinyard, was ſet upon, as if it were by Thieves at this time, and killed. Many other Senators were, without Law or Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, executed, and ſome rich Ladies. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52508:101"/> in the Provinces were for their Riches, firſt falſly accuſed, then plundered or killed. And if they wanted a Crime to faſten upon them, it was enough to ſay, that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to aſſign the Inheritance of their Eſtates to the Emperor.</p>
                     <p>The Affairs of <hi>Sarmatia</hi> about this time paſſed very well, which <hi>Perennis</hi> attributed to the Conduct of his Son there, when indeed the Honour of it was due to the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders. But at laſt this <hi>Perennis,</hi> who was<note place="margin">Perennis <hi>ſlain.</hi>
                        </note> ſo Omnipotent in the Government, having diſplaced ſome Senatours to put in others who were of the Equeſtrian Order, to command in the Army that ſerved in the War in <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and the thing being remonſtrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by their Deputies, he was on a ſudden declared an Enemy of the Army, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to be torn in pieces by the Soldiers; and <hi>Cleander,</hi> one of the Officers of the Bed-Chamber, was appointed to ſucceed in his place. Then after the Death of <hi>Perennis</hi> and his Son, who was alſo killed, <hi>Commodus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded ſeveral of his Acts, as if they had not been done by his Order, and as if he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing all things in their firſt Eſtate. But he could not hold on this ſhew and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Repentance above Thirty Days; committing worſe things afterwards by the Miniſtry of <hi>Cleander,</hi> than he had before by<note place="margin">Cleander <hi>ſucceeds in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</hi>
                        </note> that of <hi>Perennis.</hi> It was in his Miniſtry only that <hi>Cleander</hi> had ſucceeded to <hi>Perennis.</hi> For as for his Place of Captain of the Guards, <hi>Niger</hi> had that, and poſſeſſed it, they ſay, but
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52508:101"/> ſix hours. For the Captains of the Guards were changed daily and hourly; <hi>Commodus</hi> carrying himſelf in every thing now, worſe than he had done before. <hi>Martius Quartus</hi> was Captain of the Guards five Days; the reſt that followed after him, were either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or put to Death at the Pleaſure of <hi>Cleander;</hi> by whoſe Authority, manumitted Slaves were brought into the Senate, and made Patricians. We had then Five and Twenty Conſuls in One Year, which was never known before. The Governments of all the Provinces were ſold. For <hi>Cleander</hi> made a Sale of every thing for Money. He re-called what Exiles he pleaſed, and put them into Offices, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded the Acts of the Courts. He prevailed ſo much over the Weakneſs of <hi>Commodus,</hi> that when <hi>Byrrhus,</hi> who was <hi>Commodus</hi>'s Siſter's Husband, took the Liberty to blame his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and to tell <hi>Commodus</hi> what had been done, he made no more, but charged him with High-Treaſon in Revenge for it, upon which he put him to Death, and many others with him, who had ſtood in the Defence of him. Amongſt the reſt was <hi>Aebutianus</hi> the Captain of the Guards, in whoſe place <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> himſelf ſucceeded in Conjunction with Two others of his own nomination; which was the firſt time that there were Three Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Guards together, and one of thoſe was a late Slave made free.</p>

                        <hi>Pious Commodus;</hi> and when he had cut off <hi>Perennis,</hi> they called him the <hi>Happy Commodus.</hi> So this Pious, this Happy <hi>Commodus,</hi> to add to the many Murders that he had committed dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if he was a New <hi>Sylla,</hi> contrived and invented a Plot upon himſelf, for an occaſion ſtill of Murdering more. By flattery they ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him likewiſe, <hi>Conquerour of the</hi> Britains, when the <hi>Britains</hi> would have ſet up an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror againſt him. They called him the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hercules,</hi> becauſe he had ſlain Wild Beaſts in the Amphitheatre at <hi>Lavinia;</hi> which was a common Exploit with him. He arrived to that degree of Vanity, that he would have the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to be called the Colony of <hi>Commodus;</hi> which was a thing that he was put upon amidſt his Gallantries with <hi>Martia</hi> his Miſtreſs. He drove in Perſon the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots in the Races in the Cirque. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in publick in a <hi>Dalmatick,</hi> which is an effeminate Habit, and gave the Signal to the Chariots to ſtart. When he ſignified his Pleaſure to the Senate about New Naming the City of <hi>Rome, Colonia Commodiana,</hi> they pretended, not only willingly to accept the Propoſition, but called by deriſion their own Aſſembly, <hi>the Houſe of</hi> Commodus, and him nothing leſs than a <hi>Hercules</hi> and a God.</p>
                     <p>He once pretended, that he would make a Voyage into <hi>Africa;</hi> but it was for no other end, than under that pretence, he might exact
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52508:103"/> Money for his Charges, as he did, and ſpent it when he had done, in Feaſting and Gaming. He poyſoned <hi>Motilenus,</hi> a Captain of the Guards with a Fig. He had his Statues ſet up in the Habit of a <hi>Hercules,</hi> and they ſacrificed to him as to a God. He obſerved the Sacrifices of <hi>Iſis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His ſtrange Pranks.</note> inſomuch, that he ſhaved his Head, and bore the Image of <hi>Anubis</hi> upon his Shoulders about the City. He obliged the Prieſts of <hi>Bellona,</hi> out of a Spirit of cruelty, really, to cut and ſlaſh their Arms; and the Prieſts of <hi>Iſis,</hi> to beat their Breaſts with Pines, in earneſt, till they had almoſt killed themſelves. As he aſſiſted at the carrying about of the Image of <hi>Anubis,</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted himſelf with giving the Prieſts now and then, a good knock with the Head of it. Old Men that were lame and weak that they could not walk, he took, and dreſſed them up ſo, that with the Clouts and Patches which he put about them, they looked like ſo many Dragons, and then he made it his Sport to ſhoot them through with Darts. He polluted the Sacrifices of the Sun with real Homicides; whereas what at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times is uſed to be ſaid or acted there of that kind, is only a Matter of Shew.</p>
                     <p>From an Infant, he was ravenous and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; he debauched all ſorts of Perſons that came about him; and if any dared to deride him, he caſt them to the Wild Beaſts. He did this to one who had but read to him the Life of <hi>Caligula</hi> out of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> becauſe it appeared, that he and <hi>Caligula</hi> were born upon the ſame day. If any one had happened to ſay, <hi>Would I was dead,</hi> he put him to death at his word,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52508:103"/> whether he would or no. He was a pernicious Man in his Jeſts. He ſlaſhed open a fat Man croſs the Belly, for the Curioſity to ſee in an inſtant his great Guts. When he had cut off a Leg of any one, he ſaid, <hi>He was now of the Nation of the</hi> Monopodii; and when he had cut out an Eye, he called him <hi>Luſcinius</hi> (a Nightingal) by an alluſion to the word <hi>Luſcus,</hi> which ſignifies one-eyed. He murdered many in a way of gayety in places up and down; ſometimes becauſe he met them ill dreſſed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the contrary, becauſe they lookt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and handſome. He was pleaſed with Men of obſcene Names, and often kiſſed them. He had one Man with him called <hi>Onon,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in a private Part, the meaſure of almoſt any Animal, he was extremely dear and kind to him, and preferred him to be the Ruler over the Prieſts of <hi>Hercules Ruſticus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With humane ordure it is ſaid, he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led often his beſt Diſhes of Meat, and then pleaſed himſelf in drawing in the Company to eat of them. He puſht <hi>Julianus</hi> a Captain of the Guards, into a Pond in his Cloaths, as he was waiting; and at another time he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to Dance naked before his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, playing upon a Cymbal, with his Face disfigured. He ſeldom was without all ſorts of Beans, Peaſe and Pulſe-meats at his Table, for the benefit of their provocativeneſs. He bathed ſeven or eight times a day, and ſometimes eat in the very Baths. He polluted the Temples of the Gods with Whoredoms, and Murders; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he pretended to play the Surgeon, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52508:104"/> to let Blood: but then he cut off an Ear, or a Noſe, with the Inſtruments. The Months of the Year were new-named by his Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, according as he was pleaſed to have them. <hi>Auguſt</hi> was called <hi>Commodus, September</hi> was called <hi>Auguſt, October</hi> was called <hi>Hercules, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> was called <hi>Invincible, December</hi> was called <hi>Exuperatorius,</hi> and <hi>January Amazonius:</hi> which laſt Title was one that was occaſioned by his Concubine <hi>Martia;</hi> whom he fell in love with, by ſeeing her pictured in the dreſs of an <hi>Amazon;</hi> for which reaſon he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo appear'd in the Amphitheatre himſelf in an <hi>Amazonian</hi> Dreſs. He entred the Liſts with the Gladiators, and hath been as much pleas'd to be huzza'd by the Mob upon thoſe times, as if he had received a Triumph. He practiſed the Weapons in the Common School, where the Gladiators learn them. Every time that he Fought he ordered it to be entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Publick Records; and in all, it is ſaid, he Fought ſeven hundred and thirty five times.</p>
                     <p>He was created the <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the fourth of the Ides of <hi>October,</hi> under the Conſulſhips of <hi>Pudens</hi> and <hi>Pollio.</hi> He received the honour of the Title of Conqueror of the <hi>Germans</hi> upon the ſame Ides, in the Conſulſhips of <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Orphitus.</hi> He paſt into the Colleges of the Prieſts upon the thirteenth of the Calends of <hi>November,</hi> when <hi>Piſo</hi> and <hi>Julianus</hi> were Conſuls. He went into <hi>Germany,</hi> the 14. of the Calends of <hi>June</hi> (which Month he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called <hi>Aelius</hi>) under the Conſulſhips
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52508:104"/> of the ſame Perſons. He put on the <hi>Roman</hi> Gown, and was declared Emperor in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his Father, the fifth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of <hi>December,</hi> when <hi>Pollio</hi> and <hi>Aper</hi> were Conſuls, which was then the ſecond Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Pollio.</hi> He triumphed upon the tenth of the Calends of <hi>January,</hi> the ſame Perſons being Conſuls. He went his ſecond Journey into <hi>Germany,</hi> the third of the Nones of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> when <hi>Orphitus</hi> and <hi>Ruffus</hi> were Conſuls. And as he was thinking upon a third Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Senate and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him from it. Together with theſe things, it is upon Record, that he fought in Publick before his Father died, three hundred ſixty and five times. He did it again ſo often after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſtill with ſucceſs, that he ſubſcribed himſelf the <hi>Conqueror of a thouſand Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> He killed many Thouſands of wild Beaſts of divers ſorts with his own hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt Elephants; and this he did often, in the ſight of all the People of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all theſe things as vigorous as he was,<note place="margin">His great Strength.</note> he had yet a Rupture in his <hi>Scrotum,</hi> ſo large that one might diſcern it through his Silks. Many Verſes were made upon him, which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Maximus</hi> hath Collected with care. His ſtrength in killing the wild Beaſts was ſuch, that at once he hath ſtruck an Elephant thro' with his Spear, and pierced the Horn of a wild Goat with his Lance, and killed thouſands of great wild Beaſts, one after another, at a blow. He came to the Theatre and Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre often in Women's Cloaths, in which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52508:105"/> he impudently called for Wine, and drank in the ſight of all the Company. It was thus that he paſt his time, whilſt his Lieutenants abroad overcame the <hi>Moors</hi> and the <hi>Dacae,</hi> and compoſed the Troubles of <hi>Pannonia.</hi> For the Provinces of <hi>Great Britain, Germany</hi> and <hi>Dacia,</hi> had endeavoured to reject the Yoak of his Empire: but his Lieutenants quieted them. He did not care to trouble himſelf ſo much as<note place="margin">His Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</note> to ſubſcribe his Diſpatches. In many of which he uſed the ſame form; and in ſeveral of his Letters all that he writ was the word <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this ſort of Negligence, and with that waſte of Proviſions together, which was made by thoſe who were in Power under him, there aroſe a great ſcarcity at <hi>Rome,</hi> in a year that was not itſelf unfruitful. So upon this, he put ſeveral that had made that waſte, to Death, and Confiſcated their Eſtates. Then he leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened the Prices of things; but that made the Scarcity ſtill greater. Many in his time bought off another's Puniſhment, and purchaſed their own ſafety with Money. He made Money by Commutations of one Puniſhment for another, and by the Sepultures of the dead, and by putting to death ſome in others ſteads. He ſold the Governments of the Provinces: part of the Money going to thoſe by whom he ſold them, and part to himſelf: He ſold to ſome Perſons the Maſſacre of thoſe they hated: and by his example, his Servants made a Sale of the Juſtice of the Courts. He did not long continue either <hi>Paternus</hi> or <hi>Perennis,</hi>
                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:52508:105"/> Captains of the Guards. Neither did any of their Succeſſors, keep in ſo long as three en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire years under him: becauſe he diſpatched them either with Poyſon, or the Sword: and with the ſame facility he chang'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He made nothing of putting to death the Officers of his Houſhold, though they were Men who had been uſed to adviſe him in all things. One of them, by name <hi>Electus</hi> or <hi>Aelius Laetus,</hi> perceiving this, reſolved to be before Hand with him, and ſo engaged with the Party that Conſpired to his death. Beſides, he had this Cuſtom with him, that every thing he did, though never ſo Baſe, Impure, Cruel, Gladiator, or Pimp-like, he order'd it to be entred upon the Records of the City. One day fighting as a Gladiator, and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the People derided him, he had given Orders to Maſſacre them all upon the place, and burn the City: which had been Executed but that the Captain of the Guards deterred him from it. He hath been called ſix hundred times by the name of <hi>Patus,</hi> that is, the name of the Chief of the Gladiators; and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in it.</p>
                     <p>The Prodigies that attended his Reign, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Publick or Private ones, were theſe. A<note place="margin">Prodigies in his Reign.</note> Comet appear'd. The Statues of the Gods in the <hi>Forum</hi> moved their Feet, as if they had a mind to be gone. An exceſſive heat of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. On the Calends of <hi>January</hi> a great darkneſs on a ſudden covered the Cirque. Ominous Birds came in the night. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52508:106"/> out of the Palace; becauſe, he ſaid, he could not poſſibly ſleep there, unto a Houſe upon Mount <hi>Caelius.</hi> The Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> opened of it ſelf, and the Marble Image of <hi>Anubis</hi> appeared to move. The Brazen Statue of <hi>Hercules,</hi> which is at one of the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> Sweat for ſeveral days. An Owl ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared over his Bed-chamber, both at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Lavinia.</hi> He obliged Perſons to come to the Games of the Gladiators, not in their Gowns, but in ſuch other Coats as they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily were at Funerals, and preſided at them himſelf dreſſed in Black. His Helmet fell off of his Head twice at the Gate called the Gate of Death, through which the dead are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the City.</p>
                     <p>At length, although too too late, <hi>Quintus Aelius Laetus</hi> the Captain of the Guards, and <hi>Martia,</hi> one of the Concubines of <hi>Commodus,</hi> entred upon a Conſpiracy to kill him. They firſt gave him Poyſon; but that operating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectually,<note place="margin">He is ſlain.</note> they ſtrangled him by the Hands of one with whom he was uſed to Wreſtle for Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>He was of a juſt ſize and ſhape of Body, a<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</note> heavy ſottiſh ſort of a Look, no fine Diſcourſe, yellow Hair, which he uſed Art with to make it ſtill yellower: his Beard he took off him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for fear of truſting to a Barber.

                     <p>There are no Works of his extant, beſides the Baths, which <hi>Cleander</hi> built in his name. He did not ſo much as perfect thoſe of his Father. Where he had cut his own name upon the Works of others, the Senate eraſed it again. He ſet up a Corn-fleet to <hi>Carthage,</hi> to be for a relief, in caſe that other from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and the Corn from thence ſhould chance to fail: upon which he ridiculouſly called the City of <hi>Carthage, Alexandria Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moda Togata,</hi> and this Fleet of his <hi>Commodiana Herculea.</hi> He added ſome Ornaments to the Statue of the Sun, which were all afterwards aboliſhed. In the Place of the Head of <hi>Nero,</hi> he had put up his own upon the Body of it, with all his empty Titles at the bottom; not forgetting that of his Conqueſts over ſo many Gladiators, and that of <hi>Amazonius,</hi> which he took from his Miſtreſs. All which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> who was one that in no wiſe indeed differed from his name, made this Prince a God, out of his oppoſition, as it is ſuppoſed, to the Senate: and he appointed him the ſame Chief Prieſt, under the ſame Title, to ferve him, that <hi>Commodus</hi> had provided for himſelf before he died.</p>
                     <p>He left behind him three Siſters. The ſame Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> ordered the Anniverſary of his Birth to be obſerved.

                        <hi>PUblius Helvius Pertinax</hi> was the Son of<note place="margin">His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> 
                        <hi>Helvius Succeſſus,</hi> who was the Son of a late Slave made free. He had the Name of <hi>Pertinax</hi> given him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from nothing but his wilful and pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious adherence for a long time, to the poor Occupation of his Father, which was drying and burning of Wood, and making of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal. He was born in a Village in the <hi>Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine;</hi> and at the ſame time, an Accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at his Birth, which moved his Father
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52508:109"/> to go to an Aſtrologer to enquire about his Fortune; who telling him ſuch great and ſuch extraordinary things of him, as were paſt his belief, he ſaid, he had but flung away his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in conſulting him. After he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to take to Letters, and had ſtudied A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick and Greek, and was put into the hands of <hi>Sulpitius Apollinaris,</hi> he came to be a Profeſſor of Grammar himſelf. But making but little Advantage by it, he changed that courſe of Life, and by the means of <hi>Lollius Avitus,</hi> who was his Father's Patron, and had been a Conſul, he got himſelf made a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion. Then he roſe to be a Captain of a Cohort in <hi>Syria,</hi> which is a Body of Foot of, it may be, Six Hundred Men; and going Poſt into <hi>Syria</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Authority of the Emperor's Letters ſo to do, the Preſident of <hi>Syria</hi> obliged him to follow the reſt of his Journey, to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, on Foot, as far as from the City of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He deſerved very well by his Services in the<note place="margin">His pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</note> 
                        <hi>Parthian</hi> War, which made him be tranſlated into <hi>Bithynia.</hi> Then he commanded a Part of the Army in <hi>Moeſia,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Germany,</hi> where his Mother who had followed him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died, and her Sepulchre is ſaid to be ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this day. From <hi>Germany</hi> he was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the Governour of <hi>Dacia,</hi> with a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary of Two Hundred <hi>Seſtertium</hi>'s; but the Emperor <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> being made to ſuſpect him as one that was ambitious of the Empire, he was re-called from that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52508:110"/> and was afterwards choſen by <hi>Claudius Pompeianus,</hi> the Son-in-Law of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> to be his Aſſiſtant in the Command of the Auxiliaries. He behaved himſelf ſo well, that he was created in the next place a Senator. And his Innocency appearing, as to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of which before he was maliciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, for a compenſation of that Injury done him, the Emperor made him a Praetor, and gave him the Command of the Firſt Legion; by the means whereof, he preſently recovered <hi>Rhaetia,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Noricum</hi> from the Enemy. This was ſo Eminent a Service, that the Emperor made him a Conſul; who very often in publick in his Speeches, which it would be too long here to inſert, but one of them is extant in <hi>Marius Maximus,</hi> commended him both to the Soldiers and the Senate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf before all the World, ſorry, that he could not make him a Captain of the Guards, becauſe of his being a Senator. After the Rebellion of <hi>Caſſius</hi> was at an end, <hi>Pertinax</hi> was commanded out of <hi>Syria,</hi> to the Defence of the <hi>Danube.</hi> Next he was made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of both the <hi>Moeſia</hi>'s, and then of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia;</hi> and from his well managing of thoſe Provinces, he gained the Government of <hi>Syria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hitherto, that is, to his Government of <hi>Syria,</hi> he had conducted himſelf, in a manner that was altogether unblameable. But after the Death of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> he ſtrangely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his Care to the amaſſing of Money; which failed not to bring upon him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52508:110"/> of the People. He came a very rich Man into the Senate; where he firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take his place in Perſon, in the time of <hi>Commodus,</hi> after he had been the Governour of Four Conſular Provinces, and had had the Honour of a Conſulſhip given him in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But it was not long before <hi>Perennis,</hi> the great Miniſter under that Prince, baniſhed him, and commanded him to retire to the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, in the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> where his Father had kept his Charcoal-Kiln. So he came, and being there, he bought himſelf a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Land, and ſurrounded his Father's Kiln, which he left ſtanding in the ſame Form as it was before, with an infinite company of fine Buildings. He reſided there three whole Years, in which he paſt his time in his old Trade, which he carried on by his Servants. After <hi>Perennis</hi> was kill'd, <hi>Commodus</hi> took <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax</hi> into Favour, and ordered him to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Great Britain.</hi> He went, and repreſſed the Mutiny of the Forces there, who were for ſetting up a New Emperor. They would have ſet up even <hi>Pertinax</hi> himſelf. Nor was it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty that he appeaſed their Seditions. He was almoſt killed in one of them, at leaſt he was left among the dead; which he ſeverely reſented and puniſhed. Then he deſired leave to be re-called, becauſe he ſaid his Diſcipline amongſt them had made the Army averſe to him. So another Perſon being appointed to ſucceed him, he was firſt made General of the Proviſions, and ſoon after the Proconſul of <hi>Africa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:52508:111"/>
                     <p>During his Proconſulſhip of <hi>Africa,</hi> he was, they ſay, troubled with ſeveral Seditions there alſo, occaſioned by the pretended Propheſies of the Goddeſs <hi>Caeleſt is</hi> at <hi>Carthage.</hi> Then he was made the Governour of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which place ſucceeding <hi>Fuſcianus,</hi> who was a moſt ſevere Man, and he behaving himſelf on the contrary with the greateſt mildneſs and humanity, he pleaſed every one, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, <hi>Commodus</hi> ſo well, that he<note place="margin">He is made Conſul,</note> took him to be Conſul in Conjunction with himſelf; which was then the Seventh time of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Commodus.</hi> Then came on the Conſpiracy to kill <hi>Commodus,</hi> which <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax</hi> did not reject, when made acquainted with it; and the thing being done, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guards, and <hi>Electus</hi> a great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the Houſhold, came to him, and ſet him up for the Empire, and carried him to the Camp. <hi>Pertinax</hi> harangued the Soldiers, and promiſed them a Donative. He told them, how that thoſe Two great Officers had thought him a Perſon, not unworthy to be propoſed for the Empire, ſince <hi>Commodus</hi> was dead; not ſaying, that <hi>Commodus</hi> was killed, but that he was dead of a Sickneſs only. In fine, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax</hi>
                        <note place="margin">And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Emperor.</note> was ſaluted Emperor at the firſt but by a few. This was the day before the Calends of <hi>January;</hi> and he was then above Sixty Years of Age. After this, late that Night, he came from the Camp to the Senate; and the Chappel of the Senate not being ready open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, he went into the Temple of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;</hi> where <hi>Claudius Pompeianus,</hi> the Son-in-Law
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52508:111"/> of <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> meeting him, and Complementing him, <hi>Pertinax</hi> would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him, to have taken upon him the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but he refuſed it, becauſe he ſaw that <hi>Pertinax</hi> was already the Man. Immediately all the Magiſtracy with the Conſuls came to the Senate, and as ſoon as they were entred, they declared <hi>Pertinax</hi> Emperor, tho' it was then midnight.</p>
                     <p>After the Conſuls had ſet forth his Praiſes in ſuch Speeches as the occaſion required, and that the Senate had alſo ended their Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Memory of <hi>Commodus, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax</hi> returned his Solemn Thanks to them. He returned his Thanks particularly to the Captain of the Guards, by whoſe means it was, both that <hi>Commodus</hi> was cut off, and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was raiſed to be Emperor: And tho' it was true, he ſaid, as <hi>Falſo</hi> objected, that the ſaid Captain of the Guards, and <hi>Martia</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had been the Inſtruments of many of the wicked Deeds of <hi>Commodus,</hi> yet he told them, that they were to conſider the Neceſſity there was of obeying the Orders of that Prince; for otherwiſe, what they had done was againſt their own Inclination. The ſame day, his Wife <hi>Flavia Titiana</hi> was declared Empreſs. He was the firſt Emperor that ever received the Title of Father of his Country, together with the Proconſular, and the Tribunitian Powers, and the Right of a fourth Reference, the firſt day of his Reign. Which thick and ſudden accumulation of ſo many Honours, was lookt upon as an Omen but of a ſhort Reign.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52508:112"/> Then he went to the Palace, which was void, becauſe <hi>Commodus</hi> had been killed in a Houſe upon Mount <hi>Caelius,</hi> and the Tribune coming to him the firſt day for the Watch-word, his Word was, <hi>Militemus,</hi> let us Fight; which was the ſame indeed that he had given before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his Adminiſtrations; but upbraiding by it, as it ſeemed, the remiſſneſs of the times paſt, the Soldiers were touched to the Quick, and preſently thought of changing the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror again.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day, being the firſt of the New Year, he invited the Magiſtrates, and the Chief of the Senate to a Banquet, which was an antient Cuſtom that had been however omitted by <hi>Commodus.</hi> The next day as the Statues of <hi>Commodus</hi> were thrown down, the Soldiers appeared to be troubled, and ſo much the more, becauſe <hi>Pertinax</hi> had given them again the ſame Word as before; and War was a thing not to be admitted, they thought, under an Emperor ſo old as he. Upon the Third of the Nones following, tho' it was the Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Day for his acceſſion to the Empire, they would have drawn <hi>Triarius Maternus La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivius,</hi> a Noble Senator, into the Camp, to have ſet up him to be Emperor; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, and eſcaped from them, and came to the Court to <hi>Pertinax,</hi> to aſſure him of his Fidelity, and afterwards withdrew out of the Town. In the mean time, all this obliged <hi>Pertinax</hi> in fear, to confirm to the Soldiers and the <hi>Veteranes,</hi> all the Pay, and all the Gifts that had been granted them by <hi>Commodus.</hi> He
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52508:112"/> alſo courted the Senate, and owned himſelf to receive the Empire at their Hands. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them under his Oath of his innocency from having had any hand in the malverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the laſt Reign. He re-called ſuch as were in Baniſhment, and reſtored the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of others to their Honour, who had been unjuſtly put to Death. The Senate conferred the Title of <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon his Son: But as he had not yet approved the Honour which they had ſhewn to his Wife, ſo as to this of his Son; he ſaid, <hi>Let it be when he deſerves it.</hi> And whereas <hi>Commodus</hi> had added by his Authority many Perſons to the Order of the Praetors, who had never exerciſed the Office of a Praetor, and yet he allowed them to take their Places in common with thoſe that had; <hi>Pertinax</hi> paſſed an Edict as to this, to command, that thoſe who had never exerciſed the Office of a Praetor, but had received that Honour only by the Creation of <hi>Commodus,</hi> ſhould give place to ſuch as had been Praetors indeed; which brought an odium from many upon him.</p>
                     <p>He ordered the publick Account of the<note place="margin">His pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> Eſtates, and the valuation of all Perſons to be over-look'd, and ſtated a new. He ordered ſevere Puniſhments to be taken upon Perſons that had informed againſt others falſly. But yet he was not altogether ſo ſevere, as his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, with Relation to Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who were brought before him for any Crime. He made a Law, for the firſt Will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſtand good, until another that is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterior
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52508:113"/> to it is eſtabliſhed and received in due Form in its ſtead. He declared, that as for himſelf, he would never enter upon any Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, which either was devoted to him in Flattery, or by any litigious Right, or to the prejudice of the Lawful Heirs; uſing theſe Words upon the ſame occaſion, <hi>It is better, Fathers of the Senate, that the Crown ſhould be poor, than that it ſhould get never ſo much Riches by ill means, and diſhonourable Actions.</hi> The Largeſſes to the Soldiers and the People, which himſelf, and alſo <hi>Commodus</hi> had promiſed them, he paid. But yet the Exchequer was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely low at his coming to the Crown, that he declared, he had not found in it above Ten <hi>Seſtertiums;</hi> ſo that this obliged him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſome Payments which <hi>Commodus</hi> had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, although he had before promiſed to remit them. <hi>Lollianus Gentianus</hi> a Conſul, asking him therefore why he broke his Word, he told, him the Reaſon was, <hi>Neceſſity.</hi> He made an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Goods belonging to <hi>Commodus;</hi> ordered his very Bardaccio's and Concubines to be ſold, excepting ſuch of them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have been retained in the Court by him by violence. And of thoſe which were ſold, there were many that afterwards redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Fortunes, and under other Princes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived as high as to be Senators. The Buffoons and Jeſters of <hi>Commodus,</hi> ſuch as were Men of obſcene Names, he ſold, and of the Money that he made of this Negotiation, which was a great deal, he gave a Bounty to the Soldiers. He exacted alſo from the Servants of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:52508:113"/> an Account of all things that their Maſter had laviſhly given them, to enrich them.</p>
                     <p>The moſt principal Things in the Auction<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Auction of</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus'<hi>s Goods.</hi>
                        </note> of the Goods of <hi>Commodus</hi> were theſe, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Cloth of Gold, Tunicks, Cloaks, Hanging-Coats, Dalmaticks, Fringed Veſts, Coats of Mail, and others of other ſorts; Arms for the Exerciſes of the Gladiators, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with Jewels and Gold, vaſt Herculean Swords; Collars for the Gladiators; Veſſels of fine Gold, Ivory, Silver and Citron; Drinking-Veſſels, which were ſome of them of obſcene Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; other Veſſels belonging to the Arts of the Gladiators; Chariots of a rare Invention, with the Seats to turn ſo, as either to decline the Sun, or take in the Air, as you pleaſe; with other things to meaſure the Way, and ſhew the Hour; and whatever elſe was agreeable to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of that Prince in all ſorts of Vices.</p>
                     <p>As for ſuch Servants as had been taken out of private Houſes into the Court, <hi>Pertinax</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored back thoſe to their proper Maſters. He reduced the Table, and cut off all the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Expences of <hi>Commodus.</hi> He contented himſelf with a little, and the Example of his Frugality was of great effect upon all things. In fine, he reduced the Expence of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of the Emperor, to a Moiety of what it was accuſtomed to be before.</p>
                     <p>He appointed certain Recompences for the Soldiers that acquitted themſelves with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The Debts that he contracted on the firſt occaſions of his Reign, he diſcharged. He
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52508:114"/> reſtored the Credit of the Exchequer. He ſet a-part a Sum for Publick Works. He gave Money for the Reparation of the High-ways. He paid a great many Soldiers that had ſerved well, their Arrears. He put the Exchequer, in a word, in a Condition to diſcharge its Debts. But whereas there was due to the Alms-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Eſtabliſhment, the Allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Nine Years, he quite ſunk that Debt, which was ſevere, and a great Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. It is true, he was not exempt from the aſperſion of Covetouſneſs, in the time he was a private Man. He had oppreſſed with Uſury his Neighbours upon the Lake <hi>di Sabat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He was called really a Money-monger; and many have writ, that he did ſordid things in the Conſular Provinces which he governed; they ſay, that he ſold the Diſcharges from, and the Commands in the Army. His Parents had little or no Eſtate to leave him, and no Inheritances fell to him from others, yet he was grown a rich Man on a ſudden. He reſtored after he was Emperor, to every one, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates which were taken from them by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> but yet he exacted a Conſideration for it. He came conſtantly to the Senate, and always reported ſome thing or other to them. He ſhew'd himſelf always gracious to all thoſe that came to pay their Reverences to him, or ask him any Favour. He diſcharged ſome from the Accuſations of their Slaves, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged the Death of others by crucifying their Accuſers.</p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:52508:114"/>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things paſed, <hi>Falco</hi> the Conſul formed a Deſign againſt him, out of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to ſet up himſelf. <hi>Pertinax</hi> complained in the Senate of it; but however, forgave him, and begg'd his impunity of the Senate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Falco</hi> lived in Safety upon his Eſtate, and his Son was his Heir when he died. Many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſaid in his behalf, that whatever Deſign there might have been amongſt others to make him Emperor, he knew nothing of it himſelf; and that the Slaves who were his Accuſers, did him wrong, and were corrupted, and had not agreed in their Evidence. But however it is, a worſe Faction than this was made againſt <hi>Pertinax</hi> by <hi>Laetus,</hi> the Captain of the Guards, and thoſe to whom the Sanctimoniouſneſs of this Prince was offenſive. For <hi>Laetus</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented himſelf of his Services in having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him to the Crown, becauſe he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his Conduct in ſome things. Nor were the Soldiers without their Reſentments, becauſe <hi>Pertinax</hi> had put to death ſeveral in the Buſineſs of <hi>Falco,</hi> upon the ſimple Depoſition of one Slave.</p>

So they ſurprized him, as he was giving ſome Orders about the Affairs of his Houſhold; and being come up into the Gallery, as far as to a place which is called <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting-Hall of</hi> Jove, as ſoon as <hi>Pertinax</hi> knew of it, he ſent <hi>Laetus</hi> to them: but <hi>Laetus</hi> avoided them, and went another way, hiding his Face, and ſlinked Home.

The other Officers of the Chamber that were about him, fled: ſome ſay that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had broken into the Bed Chamber, and that they killed him there, hiding himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Bed.</p>
                     <p>He was a Venerable old Man, with a long<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</note> Beard, curling Hair, pretty Groſs, his Belly ſtanding a little out, of a Princely Stature; wanted not Eloquence, but was rather Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Words than thought Sincere. He
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52508:115"/> obliged every body in Words, but in Deeds was illiberal and almoſt ſordid; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in his Entertainments and Preſents. He had as yet made no Change in the Officers that had been put into the Government by <hi>Commodus;</hi> expecting the Anniverſary of the Birth-day of the City of <hi>Rome, (that is the eleventh or twelfth of the Calends of</hi> May) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he deſign'd to date from thence his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all things. And therefore they ſay the Officers of the appointment of <hi>Commodus,</hi> who were afraid to be turned out, had reſolved to kill him in the Baths by that time, if it had not been done to their Hands before.</p>
                     <p>Certainly Empire, and all the Honors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> belonging, made ſo little an impreſſion upon him, that he always ſhew'd himſelf greatly diſpleaſed with them, and he deſired to appear ſtill the ſame Man, that he had ever been. He carried himſelf to the Senate, the moſt reſpectfully in the World. When they Congratulated him, he Complemented them again, and divided his Diſcourſes to all of them, as if he was but the Governour of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> He would willingly have laid down the Empire, and have return'd to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life; and he would not ſuffer his Children to be brought up in the Court. Indeed he was ſo ſaving, and ſuch a lover of Profit, that he Trafficked at the Lake <hi>di Sabato</hi> by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when he was Emperor, in the ſame manner, as he did when he was a private Man. Perſons who ſpoke freely of him, ſaid, he was one that promiſed Well, but did No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52508:116"/> Thoſe of his own Country, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted much to him upon his being made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, obtained as good as nothing from him, and ſaid the ſame. Yet he was free to ſuffer himſelf to be preſented, with any thing to his advantage. He left a Son and a Daughter behind him; together with his Wife, who was the Daughter of <hi>Flavius Sulpitianus,</hi> whom he made the Governor of <hi>Rome</hi> in his own place. He did not much concern himſelf with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudicity of his Wife; who in the ſight of all the World entertained for her Lover, a Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. On the other hand he had for his Miſtreſs, one <hi>Cornificia;</hi> to whoſe love they ſay he was extremely abandoned. He was extraordinary ſtrict upon the Servants about the Court: and this therefore made him be much hated by them.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns forerunning his Death were theſe<note place="margin">Signs of his Death.</note> Three days before he was killed, he thought he ſaw a Man by reflexion in a Pond, making at him with a Sword. The day that he was killed, it was obſerved that the Pupils of his Eyes, as if they were dead, did not repreſent the Images of Perſons that look'd on him: and as he ſacrificed in his private Oratory, the Fire went out; and neither the Heart, nor the Liver were found in the Victims. Stars very bright, though near the Sun, appeared in the day time ſome days before. What him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid of <hi>Didius Julianus,</hi> was an Omen of the ſucceſſion to him of that Perſon. For <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> bringing his Kinſman, his Brother's Son to him, to whom he had promiſed to give
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52508:116"/> his Daughter in Marriage, he adviſed the young Man to obſerve the Commands of his Uncle, for ſays he, <hi>He is my Colleague and my Succeſſor:</hi> For he had been his Colleague in his Conſulſhip, and had ſucceeded him in his Proconſulſhip: and at laſt he ſucceeded him in the Empire too. The Soldiers and the Courtiers both hated <hi>Pertinax.</hi> But the People took his death with Indignation, becauſe they ſaw he was one, who might have re-ſettled all things in the good order as they were of old. The Soldiers that had killed him, ſtuck his Head upon a Spear, and brought it through the City into the Camp. But it was retrieved again, and together with his Body buried in the Sepulchre of his Wife's Grand-father, by <hi>Julianus,</hi> with all the honour that he could do it: only he made no publick Harangue upon him, either to the People or the Senate; but yet when afterwards it was his own fate to be in like manner deſerted, and killed, then the Senate and the People did tranſlate <hi>Pertinax</hi> into the number of the Gods.</p>
                     <p>This was done in the time of the Emperor<note place="margin">Honours paid to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> 
                        <hi>Severus;</hi> when <hi>Pertinax</hi> having had a very great Character given him by the Senate, a Royal Funeral was ſolemnized for him, in which he was repreſented by his Effigies, and <hi>Severus</hi> himſelf did him the honor to make the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his praiſe: loving the memory of him to that degree, that he was pleaſed to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Senate by the ſame name of <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax.</hi> The Son of <hi>Pertinax</hi> was made the Chief Prieſt to his Father; and the Prieſts of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52508:117"/> Emperor <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> were appointed, as his Aſſociates. The Games of the Cirque were Celebrated for his Aſcenſion to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the day of his Birth was kept: which laſt is remaining ſtill: but the others were afterwards laid aſide by <hi>Severus.</hi> He was born upon the Calends of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> under the Conſulſhips of <hi>Verus</hi> and <hi>Bibulus.</hi> He was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the fifth of the Calends of <hi>April,</hi> in the Conſulſhips of <hi>Falco</hi> and <hi>Clarus.</hi> He lived ſixty ſix Years, ſeven Months, and twenty ſix Days. He Reigned two Months, and twenty ſeven days. He gave a Largeſs to the People of a hundred <hi>Roman</hi> Penies a Man: and he had promiſed another to the Guards of twelve thouſand Seſterces; but he gave them but the half: what he had promiſed the Army, was not given them, becauſe his death prevented him. There is a Letter of his, in the Hiſtory of his life, written by <hi>Marius Maximus,</hi> which I have not thought fit to inſert here, becauſe of its too great length, but which is a certain Proof, that <hi>Pertinax</hi> was one that had a Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for the Station of an Emperor.</p>

                     <p>He was once accuſed by one <hi>Severus Clariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus,</hi> a Soldier, of being in a Conſpiracy with <hi>Salvius Julianus,</hi> againſt <hi>Commodus.</hi> But becauſe <hi>Commodus</hi> had already put many Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to death, who were great and powerful Perſons, and becauſe he was willing a while to forbear his further Cruelty, <hi>Didius Julia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was diſcharged at that time, and his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer Condemned; after which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded again to his Province. Then he had the Government of <hi>Bithynia</hi> given him; in which however he came ſhort of that Fame, that he had acquired in his other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Next he was made a Conſul in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with <hi>Pertinax,</hi> and he ſucceeded to <hi>Pertinax</hi> in the Proconſulſhip of <hi>Africa;</hi> who therefore always called him his Collegue and his Succeſſor: But this was more eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked to be Ominous, one day when <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> came with his Kinſman to him, when Emperor, to be Contracted to a Daughter of <hi>Pertinax.</hi> For as <hi>Pertinax</hi> received him with the reſpect and kindneſs that was due; he ſaid to him at the ſame time, You, Sir, <hi>Are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now he who firſt put up to be Emperor after the death of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> was <hi>Sulpitianus,</hi> who was then in the Camp of the Guards. In the mean time the Senate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled; whither <hi>Julianus</hi> together with his Son-in-Law coming, and finding the Doors ſhut, and the two Tribunes <hi>P. Florianus</hi> and <hi>Vectius Aper</hi> ſtanding at the Door, thoſe two
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52508:119"/> Tribunes began to perſuade him to poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Empire that was vacant. To which he anſwering, that it was already di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed of to another, they nevertheleſs took him even againſt his will, and carried him to the Camp: where they found <hi>Sulpitianus,</hi> who was the Governor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Son-in-Law to <hi>Pertinax,</hi> haranguing the Soldiers in his own favour ſo ſtrongly, that they refuſed to hearken in the leaſt to <hi>Julianus,</hi> till he had wiſely adviſed them not to make Choice of one who would Revenge the Murder of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> who was Father-in-Law to him; and then they all immediately tacked about to <hi>Julianus;</hi> who giving it them under his Hand in Writing, that he would reſtore the Memory of <hi>Commodus,</hi> they proclaimed him, engaging him to bear no diſpleaſure however againſt <hi>Sulpitianus</hi> for the Pretenſions which he had made to their Favour.</p>
                     <p>Then he Choſe, by their Advice, <hi>Flavius Gentalis,</hi> and <hi>Tullius Criſpinus</hi> to be the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Guards; and whereas he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that he would give the Soldiers a Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of five and twenty thouſand Seſterces, he gave them thirty. In the Evening, after he had Harangued them according to Cuſtom, he came from the Camp to the Senate, to whom he intirely referred himſelf: the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate accepted him; and firſt Inrolled him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Families of the Patricians; then they declared him Emperor. The Tribunitian<note place="margin">Declar'd Emperor.</note> and the Proconſular Powers were conferred upon him; and his Wife called <hi>Mallia Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla,</hi>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:52508:119"/> and his Daughter <hi>Didia Clara</hi> were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by them with the Titles of Empreſs, and Princeſs. From the Senate he repaired to the Palace, whither he took his Wife and Daughter with him; but they went trembling, and againſt their wills, as if their minds gave them ſome ſecret Preſages of an approaching Deſtruction. He made <hi>Cornelius Repentinus,</hi> his Son-in-Law, the Governor of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the place of <hi>Sulpitian.</hi> But in the mean time the Populace bore to <hi>Julianus</hi> a Publick hatred, as if he would revive the times of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> and as if he had been the Murderer of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> becauſe he propoſed to amend his Faults. They pretended to ſay further, that deſpiſing the Frugal Table of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> he had from the firſt day provided himſelf ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was Luxurious, full of all ſorts of excellent Meats; but this however was falſe. For beſides that his Table was ſufficiently Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, he did not Eat at all the firſt day, till the Body of <hi>Pertinax</hi> was buried; and then he did it with a great Melancholy upon him, and ſpent all the night afterwards ſleepleſs, he was ſo concerned for his Friend's death.</p>
                     <p>The next Morning, as ſoon as it was light, the Senate and the Gentry coming to wait upon him at the Palace; he admitted them, and called them all, with a great deal of Civility, according to every one's Age, his Father, or his Son, or his Brother. Nevertheleſs the Populace both in the <hi>Forum,</hi> and before the Houſe of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, loaded him with perpetual Reproaches, as if they hoped by that means to oblige him
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52508:120"/> to lay down the Empire, that he had received at the Hands of the Soldiers. They threw a Shower of Stones at him; and as he came to the Senate Curſed him publickly, and Curſed him again as he was at his Devotions, by which they wiſhed he might never obtain any thing of the Gods. In the mean time as they threw Stones at him, he only waved his Hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them to Pacifie them: and what he ſaid to the Senate was very ſweet and prudent. He thanked them that they had admitted him to Adminiſter, in Conjunction with them, the Soveraign Power; and for the Honor they had done, not only to himſelf, but to his Wife and his Daughter. He accepted from them the Title of the <hi>Father of the Country;</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to have his Statue ſet up in Silver, which they offered him. Going from the Senate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Capitol, the Populace made a ſtop to him; till they were forced aſide, partly by Blows with Sword in Hand, and partly by good Words and promiſes of Money. From thence he went to the Publick Games in the Cirque; where the People Crowding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indifferently into all the Seats, redoubled their outragious Reproaches againſt him; and called aloud upon <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> who was ſaid to have already taken upon him the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Emperor, to come to the Succour of the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet all this took he quietly, and appeared to be of an extraordinary ſweet Temper all the time of his Reign. The People inveighed no leſs bitterly againſt the Soldiers, who had kill'd <hi>Pertinax,</hi> they ſaid for Money. To
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52508:120"/> conciliate therefore the favour of theſe People, ſeveral things which <hi>Commodus</hi> had well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and <hi>Pertinax</hi> had aboliſhed, <hi>Didius Julianus</hi> reſtored again. He ſpoke nothing, neither good nor bad, as to <hi>Pertinax</hi> himſelf; which ſeemed to ſeveral to be very ſtrange; but the only reaſon, why he was ſilent of his Honor, was the fear of the Soldiers, who had killed him.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Julianus</hi> had no apprehenſion of any Oppoſition being made to him on the ſide either of the Forces in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> or thoſe in <hi>Illyricum.</hi> But fearing eſpecially thoſe in <hi>Syria,</hi> which were commanded by <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> he ſent a Centurion thither with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to cut him off. Hereupon <hi>Peſcennius Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Niger <hi>and</hi> Severus <hi>revolt.</hi>
                        </note> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> revolted from <hi>Julianus</hi> with the Armies under their Commands. Being told of the latter, from whom he had ſuſpected nothing; he came in Anger to the Senate, and cauſed him to be declared an Enemy, and the Soldiers with him, unleſs they deſerted him by ſuch a day: to whom Meſſengers were ſent at the ſame time from the Senate, to perſuade them to renounce <hi>Severus,</hi> and adhere to <hi>Julianus.</hi> Amonſt whom was <hi>Veſpronius Candidus,</hi> who was a great Senior in the Rank of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, but hated of old by the Soldiers, becauſe of his Severities. <hi>Valerius Catulinus</hi> was ſent in the Quality of Succeſſor to <hi>Severus:</hi> as if it was an eaſie thing to be the Succeſſor of a Man, who had an Army to defend him. Together with theſe was ſent <hi>Aquilius,</hi> the Centurion, a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52508:121"/> known Aſſaſſin, who having already mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered many Senators, might try his Hand once again, and do no leſs to <hi>Severus.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Didius Julianus</hi> ordered the Guards to be exerciſed, and their Camp to be refortified. But as the Soldiers were become idle, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute by being accuſtomed to the Luxuries of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was very much againſt their wills, that they were brought to their Arms; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they hired others for Money to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their places, and do their duties in their ſteads.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> took his march towards the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Army under his Command; whilſt the People there, every day more both hated and derided <hi>Julianus.</hi> Nor was he able to do any good upon the Soldiers of the Guards; and thinking that <hi>Laetus</hi> was a Favourer of the Cauſe of <hi>Severus,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully commanded him to be killed, who was one that had formerly ſaved his life from the Hands of <hi>Commodus;</hi> and <hi>Martia</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be killed with him. But whilſt theſe things were in paſſing, <hi>Severus</hi> poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Fleet and City of <hi>Ravenna;</hi> and the Embaſſadors of the Senate, that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed this Succour to <hi>Julianus,</hi> changed ſides, and engag'd on the part of <hi>Severus.</hi> Alſo <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Criſpinus,</hi> the Captain of the Guards, who had been ſent to make Head againſt his Troops, received a defeat, and returned back by <hi>Rome.</hi> When <hi>Julianus</hi> ſaw all this, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Senate, that the <hi>Veſtal Virgins</hi> and all the Prieſts, together with the Senate,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52508:121"/> ſhould march forth to meet the Army of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> Arrayed all in their ſeveral Habits, and ſhould conjure and perſuade him fairly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his Hoſtilities. A vain thing indeed, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of an Army of deſperate Soldiers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Fauſtinus Quintillus,</hi> an Augur, and a Conſul, took the liberty to contradict him in that Propoſal; and boldly ſaid, to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Senators gave their conſents; <hi>That a Man was not fit to Command, who could not reſiſt his Adverſary by force of Arms. Julianus</hi> in great Anger ſent for Soldiers out of the Camp, to force the Senate into a Compliance with him, or Maſſacre them upon the place. But neither did this take. For certainly it was very unreaſonable, that when the Senate had adjudged <hi>Severus</hi> an Enemy upon the account of <hi>Julianus,</hi> the ſame <hi>Julianus</hi> ſhould turn ſuch a Butcherer of the Senate. So he came to the Senate with another and a better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, which was that there might be an Act for the participation of the Empire betwixt<note place="margin">Severus <hi>declar'd Partner in the Empire.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Severus</hi> and him, and this was done imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. Every one now called to mind an Omen of all this, which came from the Mouth of <hi>Julianus</hi> himſelf, when he had the Empire given him. For when the Conſul had ſaid in the name of the Senate, I order <hi>Didius Julianus</hi> to be proclaimed Emperor, <hi>Julianus</hi> prompted and corrected him thus, ſay <hi>Didius Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus Severus,</hi> that is, becauſe <hi>Severus</hi> was a third name which he took from his Grandfather, and Great Grandfather. Some indeed deny, that there was any ſuch Order of his, as that of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52508:122"/> murdering the Senate, who had been ſo kind to him. But however that is, after paſſing that Act, he ſent immediately <hi>Tullius Criſpinus,</hi> his Captain of the Guards, to Complement <hi>Severus.</hi> He alſo Created <hi>Veturius Macrinus,</hi> another Captain of the Guards; becauſe he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that <hi>Severus</hi> had ſent Letters to make him one. In the mean time the People ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, and <hi>Severus</hi> ſuſpected as much, that this Peace was but a Feint, and that <hi>Tullius Criſpinus</hi> was ſent to him rather with private Orders to kill him. So <hi>Severus,</hi> with the advice of his Army, choſe to be his declared Enemy, rather than his Partner; and accordingly he writ to a great many Perſons in <hi>Rome,</hi> his Friends, who ſecretly received and diſpatched his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. As for the reſt, <hi>Julianus</hi> tried all ſorts of things by the Magicians, that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to mitigate the hatred of the People, or to bridle the Arms of the Enemy. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Magicians offered ſuch Sacrifices for him upon this occaſion, as were by no means conſonant to the Rites of the <hi>Romans.</hi> They tried their Charms in Profane Verſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Charms which they do with a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs: but yet all went ill on the ſide of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus;</hi> and all that they diſcovered from them was, the coming in of the one, and the departure of the other Emperor.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Tullius Criſpinus</hi> came as far as to meet the Avant-Guards of <hi>Severus,</hi> he was killed by his order, in which he followed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that was given him by <hi>Julius Laetus.</hi> Then <hi>Julianus</hi> convoked the Senate again,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52508:122"/> and asked their Opinions, what more was to be done; but the Senate could not reſolve him. He ordered after that, of his own motion, the Gladiators of <hi>Capua</hi> to take Arms under the Command of <hi>Lollianus Titianus.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited <hi>Claudius Pompeianus,</hi> from his Retreat at <hi>Tarracina,</hi> to joyn with him in the Government, becauſe he had long commanded Armies, and was the Son-in-Law of an Emperor. But <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peianus</hi> excuſed himſelf, and ſaid, he was an Old Man, and wanted his ſight. In the mean time, the Army of <hi>Severus</hi> was encreaſed, by Soldiers that came to him out of the Province of <hi>Ombria;</hi> and he ſent Letters before him to <hi>Rome,</hi> to order the Murderers of <hi>Pertinax</hi> to be ſecured. So in a little time, <hi>Didius Julianus</hi> was abandoned by all the World, and remained in the Court, with only <hi>Genialis,</hi> one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Guards, and his Son-in-Law <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The next thing was to depoſe<note place="margin">He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> him from the Empire, by the Sentence of the Senate: This was done, and all his Power abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and <hi>Severus</hi> immediately declared Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in his place. Afterward it was pretended that he had poyſoned himſelf; but in effect, there were Perſons immediately ſent on the part of the Senate, who cauſed him to be killed by the hands of a mercenary Soldier, imploring, as he fell, the Faith of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> that is, <hi>Severus.</hi> He had given all his Paternal Eſtate to his Daughter, and emancipated her upon his Elevation to the<note place="margin">And ſlain.</note> Empire. But as well her Riches, as her Illuſtrious Title of Princeſs, were ſoon taken from her again. His Body was delivered by <hi>Severus,</hi> to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52508:123"/> 
                        <hi>Manlia Scintilla</hi> his Wife, and to his Daughter, to be buried; who put it into a Tomb of his great Grandfather, five Miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the <hi>Via Lavicana,</hi> that is, the High-way, called by that Name.</p>
                     <p>Now the things condemned in this Prince were theſe; that he gormandized, that is, eat to exceſs, gam'd much, plaid at the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of the Gladiators; and did all this, being an Old Man, tho' he had never before been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to thoſe Vices in his Youth; and that he was Proud; but this is not to be believed, for in his Reign he ſhewed himſelf the moſt humble Man in the World; the moſt obliging in his Entertainments; the moſt courteous in his Subſcription of himſelf in his Letters, and of a moſt excellent Temper in allowing of the Liberties of his Friends. He lived Six and Fifty Years and Four Months; and reigned but Two Months and Five Days. Therefore his great Error was, that he ought by his abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to have governed thoſe, whom on the contrary he made abſolute over himſelf, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the State.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed in Publick. Afterwards he came to <hi>Rome</hi> to make his Studies; where through the Favour of his Kinſman, <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> who had been twice Conſul, he received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Emperor <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> to be<note place="margin">He is made a Senator.</note> created a Senator. Now his Landlord with whom he lodged at <hi>Rome,</hi> upon his firſt coming thither, was at that moment Reading the Life of the Emperor <hi>Hadrian,</hi> which he was quick to obſerve, as an Omen to himſelf of future Grandeur. Another Omen that he had, was more parcicularly, as to his Reign, which was this; being once invited to a Banquet of the Emperor, he came in his Cloak, when he ought to have come in his Gown; which the Emperor taking Notice of, he gave him a Gown of his own to put on, which was the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52508:124"/> ſame that he wore when he ſate in Judgment. The ſame Night he dreamt that he ſucked the Breaſts of a Wolf, as if he was a <hi>Remus</hi> or a <hi>Romulus.</hi> He ſate himſelf down in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Chair, which a Servant had put out of its place, without thinking any thing of it, nor knowing that this was not permitted. As he was aſleep once at his Lodgings, a Serpent came and had twiſted it ſelf about his Head; which the Servant perceiving, cried out, and he awaked, and the Serpent went from him again without doing him any hurt.</p>
                     <p>His Youth was full of Fury and Wildneſſes, which were ſometimes criminal. He was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned for Adultery, but was acquitted by <hi>Didius Julianus,</hi> the Proconſul of <hi>Africa,</hi> to whom he ſucceeded in the Charge of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſulſhip, and was his Colleague in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, and again ſucceeded him in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He diſcharged his Queſtorſhip of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> very well, into which he was elected unanimouſly. Afterwards he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a Military Queſtor, that is, Pay-Maſter, or Commiſſary to the Army, for the Province of <hi>Hiſpania Boetica.</hi> From thence he went into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> to receive the Succeſſion to his Father who was dead there. And whilſt he was in <hi>Africa,</hi> inſtead of the Province of <hi>Boetica,</hi> he was made the Queſtor for the Iſland of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Moors</hi> had laid waſte <hi>Hiſpania Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica.</hi> This Adminiſtration being over, he was advanced to be the Proconſul of <hi>Africa;</hi> in which place a Plebeian of his own Town of <hi>Napoli di Barbaria</hi> coming to him, whilſt the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52508:125"/> Rods were carried before him, and preſuming to embrace him, as his old Companion, he ordered him to be taken and well Cudgelled, with this Inſcription over his Head, <hi>You who are a Plebeian, have a care of touching ſo a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul of the People of</hi> Rome. Since which time, the Cuſtom is for the Proconſuls to go out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a Coach, whereas before they walked on Foot. He conſulted, being in <hi>Africa,</hi> with an Aſtrologer, about his Fortune, which he was ſolicitous to know.

                     <p>By the Favour of the Emperor <hi>Marcus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi> he was made a <hi>Tribune of the People,</hi> which he diſcharged with the greateſt Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all the Strictneſs that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. Then he married <hi>Martia,</hi> of whom he ſays nothing himſelf, in his Hiſtory of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Life. But after he was Emperor, he ſet up her Statues. In the Thirty Second Year of his Age, he was choſen a Praetor, before a Number of others that were Competitors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.

He gave the People the diverſion of the publick Shews in his abſence. Then he had the command of the Fourth Legion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Scythica,</hi> which was in <hi>Syria.</hi> In his way to which, he went to <hi>Athens,</hi> for the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of obſerving the Studies and the Rites, the Works, and the Antiquities of that Seat of the Muſes: But becauſe he received ſome Injuries there from the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he became their Enemy; and when he was Emperor, he was willing to avenge himſelf of them, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhort their Privileges Next he was re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moved to the Province of the <hi>Lionnois</hi> in <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> to be the Lieutenant there. And having loſt his Wife, and propoſing to marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he took the Care firſt to be informed, being very well vers'd in the knowledge of Aſtrology himſelf, in the Nativities of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes; and as he had heard, that there was a Lady in <hi>Syria,</hi> who had found by her Nativity, that ſhe was to be married to a King, he court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and in fine, married her, whoſe Name<note place="margin">His ſecond Marriage</note> was <hi>Julia,</hi> by whom he was ſoon after made a Father.</p>
                     <p>His Exactneſs, his Honour, and his great Sobriety, cauſed him to be ſo much beloved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as never Perſon was. He was tranſlated from thence to the Government of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> with a Proconſular Power. From <hi>Pannonia</hi> to <hi>Sicily,</hi> which was another Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip; and when he had made his return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Rome,</hi> he received of his Wife a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52508:126"/> Son. Being in <hi>Sicily,</hi> he was accuſed of conſulting the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and the Aſtrologers about his coming to the Empire, for which he was ordered to be heard before the Captains of the Guards; who, it then being the time that the Emperor <hi>Commodus</hi> began to fall into an univerſal odium, acquitted him, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Man that calumniated him. He was Conſul the firſt time in Conjunction with <hi>Apuleius Ruffinus,</hi> by the particular appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Commodus.</hi> After his Conſulſhip, he continued an entire Year at <hi>Rome,</hi> without Employ; and then by the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Laetus,</hi> he was preferred to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Army in <hi>Germany.</hi> He had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till now at <hi>Rome,</hi> in a very little Houſe with one ſmall Plat of Ground to it. But as he went to take the Poſſeſſion of this laſt Charge, he purchaſed himſelf a ſpatious <hi>Villa;</hi> where once taking a ſmall Repaſt together with his little Infants, and Fruit being brought, his Eldeſt Son, who was then of the Age of Five Years, diſtributed it amongſt the Children, his Play. Fellows, ſo liberally, that his Father ſaid to him, <hi>Not ſo faſt, my Son, you have not the Riches of a King.</hi> The Child of Five Years old, anſwered, <hi>But I ſhall have.</hi> So being gone to his Command in <hi>Germany,</hi> he acquitted himſelf in that ſort, that he raiſed his Name, which was already ennobled, to a far higher pitch of Glory.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto he had followed Arms, but in the Quality of a private Perſon. But now the News coming that <hi>Commodus</hi> was killed,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52508:126"/> and that <hi>Didius Julianus,</hi> who for the preſent was upon the Throne, was univerſally hated; the <hi>German</hi> Legions encouraged him no leſs than he declined it, to put up for the Empire. They declared him Emperor upon the Ides of<note place="margin">Declared Emperor by the Army.</note> 
                        <hi>Auguſt;</hi> at the ſame time he gave them a Bounty of Fifty Thouſand <hi>Seſterces,</hi> which was more than any Prince had ever done before; and having ſecured the Provinces which he left at his Back, he haſtened his March to <hi>Rome.</hi> Every one opened the way to him in all the places where he came. The Armies of <hi>Illyricum</hi> and <hi>Gallia,</hi> ſwore Fidelity to him. And every where they received him, as the Avenger of the Murder of <hi>Pertinax.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Didius Julianus</hi> prevailed with the Senate to declare him an Enemy, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſent their Commiſſioners to his Army to command the Soldiers in their Names to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his Service. It is true, it put him firſt into a great concern: but afterwards he managed the thing ſo, that he corrupted thoſe very Commiſſioners, ſo that they ſpoke to the Soldiers for him, and came over themſelves to his ſide. <hi>Julianus</hi> who was ſoon advertiſed of a Conduct ſo extraordinary, obtained then a Decree of the Senate, in which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Empire ſhould be participated betwixt himſelf and <hi>Severus:</hi> but whether this was with a ſincere, or a treacherous Intention, it is uncertain, becauſe in truth, he had before ſent ſome known Aſſaſſines to him, to kill him; and others, at the ſame time, to kill <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> who had alſo taken up the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52508:127"/> Empire againſt him, upon the Authority of the Forces in <hi>Syria.</hi> However it was, <hi>Severus</hi> eſcaped their Hands, and writ Letters to the Guards at <hi>Rome</hi> to abandon and ſlay <hi>Julianus;</hi> which was executed upon him accordingly, as he was in the Court, and <hi>Severus</hi> was invited to enter into <hi>Rome;</hi> who with a Fortune, which hath never happened to any before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Conqueror as it were with a Word,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Enters</hi> Rome.</note> and ſo marched on to <hi>Rome</hi> at the Head of his Troops.</p>
                     <p>He kept himſelf all the while in his Camps and Tents, in his march in <hi>Italy,</hi> no leſs than if he ſtill appeared there with the face of an Enemy. The Senate deputed a Hundred out of their Body, as their Envoys to compliment and congratulate him; who came up to him at the City of <hi>Teramo</hi> in <hi>Abruzzo.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them when they ſaluted him, all in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and in the midſt of his armed Troops. The next day all the Domeſticks of the Court arrived to pay their Reverences to him. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Envoys of the Senate with ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Pieces of Gold, and diſmiſſed them. But yet if they pleaſed, he welcomed them to ſtay and to return to <hi>Rome</hi> in his Company. Then he immediately made <hi>Flavius Juvenalis</hi> the Captain of the Guards, who was one that <hi>Julianus</hi> had choſen to be a third Captain of the ſame under him. In the mean time, the Trouble was very great at <hi>Rome,</hi> amongſt the Soldiers and the Citizens; becauſe <hi>Severus</hi> whom they judged their Enemy, approached to them with a puiſſant Army. At the ſame
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52508:127"/> time the Legions in <hi>Syria</hi> had ſet up <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> Emperor; whoſe Edicts therefore, and whoſe Letters to the People or to the Senate, <hi>Severus</hi> intercepted, that they ſhould not be read to the one or the other. And as he judged very well, that it concerned him to ſecure himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he ſent <hi>Heraclius</hi> to take in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Bithynia;</hi> and <hi>Plautianus,</hi> to make himſelf Maſter of the Children of <hi>Peſcennius Niger.</hi> Then coming up to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> before he made his entrance into it, he ordered the old Guards there to appear before him without their Arms, which they did, and he held a Council of War upon them, and ſurrounded them with Guards of his own Troops.</p>
                     <p>In fine, as he made his publick Entrance into the City, himſelf and his Soldiers, all under their Arms, he took his way ſtrait up to the Capitol. From the Capitol, he proceeded in the ſame form to the Palace, with the Banners which he had taken from the old Guards carried before him, not fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but furled, as in mourning. All the City over did the Soldiers ſpread themſelves, and filled the Temples, the Piazza's, and the Houſes of the Court, like ſo many Inns. At their Diſcretion they took all things, without Buying, and threatned to plunder all the City; ſo that certainly one may ſay, the Entrance of <hi>Severus</hi> was odious and terrible. The next day he came, accompanied with his Friends, and a great Guard of his armed Soldiers, to the Senate, where he gave the Senate an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his aſſumption of the Empire, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52508:128"/> complained, that <hi>Didius Julianus</hi> had ſent Men, who were known Aſſaſſines, to him, to kill him. He obliged them to paſs an Act, that it ſhould be unlawful for the Emperor to put to death a Senator, without taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Senate. But whilſt he was there, the Army that had brought him in, demanded of the Senate ſeditiouſly ten thouſand Seſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, after the example of thoſe who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly brought in <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and had received that Sum. <hi>Severus</hi> would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them, but he could not, without ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them with Money; which ſent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way pacified. In the next place, in honour of the Memory of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> he ſolemnized a Royal Funeral for him, in which he was repreſented by his Image; and he Conſecrated him a God, and appointed his Prieſts. He was willing to be called <hi>Pertinax</hi> himſelf, till the complaints of his Friends made him aboliſh the name again, as if it was ominous of a ſhort Reign.</p>
                     <p>After this he rendred to every one what belonged to him; and he married his two Daughters, having endowed them well, to <hi>Probus</hi> and <hi>Aetius.</hi> To the former of whom he offered the Government of the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> but he refuſed it, and ſaid, <hi>That he thought it leſs to be the Governor of</hi> Rome, <hi>than to be the Son in Law of a Prince.</hi> He made both of them Conſuls, and gave them great Riches. Another day he came to the Senate, and made a Proſcription of the Friends of <hi>Didius Julianus;</hi> ſuch as againſt whom there were Accuſations brought, and afterwards or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52508:128"/> them to be Executed. He heard a great many Cauſes Pleaded before him. He ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed the Magiſtrates of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, who ſtood accuſed by their People, if he found the matter of their Accuſations proved againſt them. He looked ſo well after the affair of the Magazines of Corn, which he found in a very low condition, that when he died, he left enough for ſeven years to come. He took up an Expedition into the Eaſt to eſtabliſh the State of Affairs there; not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing as yet openly of <hi>Peſcennius Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> only he immediately ſent ſome Legions into <hi>Africa,</hi> for fear that <hi>Niger</hi> ſhould poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Alexandria</hi> or <hi>Carthage</hi> by the way of <hi>Libya</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo afflict the People of <hi>Rome</hi> with a want of Corn. He left <hi>Domitius Dexter,</hi> Governor of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the place of <hi>Baſſus,</hi> and within thirty days of his coming thither, he ſet out from it again. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">
                           <hi>His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt</hi> Niger.</note> he had marched as far as to a place called <hi>Saxa Rubra,</hi> he had an occaſion to appeaſe a great Sedition which was ariſen in his Army up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject of their Encampments.

After this, he did a great many things about <hi>Arabia.</hi> He obliged the <hi>Parthians</hi> to yield to him, and the People of the Country of <hi>Adiabene,</hi> who were all in the ſame Intereſts with <hi>Peſcennius Niger.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at his return, he was offered the honour of Triumph, and was Entitled Conqueror of the <hi>Arabians, Adiabenians,</hi> and <hi>Parthians;</hi> but the Triumph he refuſed; leſt it ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he triumphed a for Victory, gained as it were over his own Subjects, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Style of Conqueror of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> not to offend the <hi>Parthians</hi> too ſenſibly.</p>
                     <p>But no ſooner was he returning to <hi>Rome</hi> from the Civil-War of <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> but he had the News of another, which he was to<note place="margin">

But yet as to ſome, who were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he excuſed himſelf, and denied that it had been done by his order; and particularly <hi>Marius Maximus</hi> ſays, he did it in the Caſe of <hi>Laetus.</hi> His own Siſter making him a Viſit from the Town of <hi>Napoli di Barbaria,</hi> where he was born, had brought her Son along with her: and as ſhe was one that was ſcarce able to ſpeak the Latin Tongue, ſhe made the Emperor bluſh for her very much: who gave her ſeveral rich Preſents, and made her Son a Senator; but when that was done, he ordered her to go back to her own Country again, and take her Son with her, who ſoon after died.</p>
                     <p>The Summer being over, becauſe in thoſe Parts the Winter is the beſt Seaſon for War, he entred into the Kingdom of <hi>Parthia;</hi> and obliging the Enemy to give way to him, he marched forward, and ſet himſelf down before <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> which he took. But as his Soldiers had lived but upon the Roots of the Herbs which they found, whereby they had contracted great ſickneſſes, and particularly the Flux, which hindered their Marches, he ſatisfied himſelf with the Conqueſt which he had made, having killed a great number of the Enemy, and put to ſlight their King, which gained him the Title of Conqueror of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> His eldeſt Son the Caeſar <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionus Antoninus,</hi> of thirteen years of Age, was

                        </gap>, and appointed him to be Conſul with himſelf. Accordingly they both entred upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhips in <hi>Syria.</hi> After which, having gratified the Army with a Bounty upon that Subject, they took their way to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Expedition he made a great many Laws to Eſtabliſh the Rights of the People of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> He forbad Men to turn <hi>Jews,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great penalty, and he made the like Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as to the Chriſtians. He granted to the City of <hi>Alexandria</hi> the Privilege of a Senate; beſides which he changed their Laws in ſeveral things. He was much pleaſed with his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into theſe Parts, to ſee the Worſhip of the God <hi>Serapis,</hi> and becauſe of the ſingular ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52508:133"/> of the Animals, and places which he ſaw here. He viewed <hi>Memphis</hi> and <hi>Memnon,</hi> the Pyramids and the Labyrinth, with great Care and great Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>It would be too tedious to purſue the Life of this Prince in Matters of a leſſer Note. Therefore his diminiſhing the Power of the Pretorian Guards at <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Julianus</hi> was conquered and killed, and his conſecrating <hi>Pertinax</hi> a God, contrary to the Will of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, were bold and great Actions. He ſeems to have deſerved the Name of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> (which once he aſſumed) not ſo much for his Affection to <hi>Pertinax</hi> the Emperor, as for the auſterity of his manners, and his own pertinaciouſneſs in what he did. As one of the Enemy, who was taken had caſt himſelf humbly at his Feet, and ſaid to him; <hi>Sir, what would your ſelf have done in my place?</hi> He not at all ſoftened with ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent an Expreſſion, commanded him to be killed without remorſe. He was bent upon utterly extirpating the Parties that were againſt him, and almoſt from no place did he come off leſs than Conqueror.</p>
                     <p>He conquered <hi>Abgarus,</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His other Succeſſes.</note> The <hi>Arabians</hi> yielded themſelves under his Obedience. He made the <hi>Adiabeni</hi> Tributary to him. He fortified <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which is the greateſt Ornament of his Reign, with a Trench drawn croſs the Iſland, from the one Ocean to the other, from whence he received the Title of <hi>Conqueror of the</hi> Britains. He put his Native Country of <hi>Tripoli</hi> into a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greateſt Security, and a laſting
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52508:134"/> Peace, by ſubduing thoſe moſt Warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which lie all about it; for which the <hi>Tripolines</hi> in return, preſented him with Oyl and Corn, every Year in abundance; and gave for that purpoſe ſome fruitful Fields for ever to the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> As he was of a Temper to be implacable towards ſuch as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed their Duty; ſo on the other hand, he was of a ſingular good Judgment in making Choice of Perſons to ſerve him, who were Men of Fidelity. He was much addicted to the Studies of Philoſophy and Eloquence, and had a deſire to know the reſt of the Sciences He was a mortal hater of Robbers. He writ his own Life himſelf faithfully, as he was a private Man, and as he Emperor; in which however, he excuſes as much as he can, the Fault of his Cruelty. The Senate gave this Judgment upon him, that either he ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have been born, or he ought never to die. Becauſe he ſeemed at once to be too Cruel to keep, and too uſeful to loſe.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, as to his Affairs within his<note place="margin">His Wife ſuſpected.</note> own Family, he was not ſo very Prudent. For the Virtue of his Wiſe <hi>Julia</hi> was much to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. She was alſo an Accomplice in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy that was form'd againſt him, yet he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, and kept her with him. Whilſt he lay lame of the Gout in his Feet, which retarded the Operations of the War, which the Army bore impatiently, they had nominated his Son <hi>Baſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> to march as Emperor at the Head of them. <hi>Severus</hi> immediately upon this, called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, to which, cauſing himſelf to be
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52508:134"/> taken up, and carried and placed upon the Tribunal; and having cited to it all the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, Centurions, Captains, and the principal Officers of the Army, that had been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that Action, together with his Son; he demanded of them all, <hi>Whether they were returned to their Duty?</hi> who all, except his Son, whom he had pardoned, proſtrating themſelves before him for mercy; ſays he, <hi>I hope now you are ſatisfied, it is the Head that rules, and not the Feet.</hi> Another very remarkable Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his, is, being one whom Fortune had raiſed from a low Birth by ſeveral degrees to the Empire, with the Aſſiſtance of Letters, and the Knowledge that he had acquired in Arms; ſays he, <hi>I have been all things, and all's worth nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He died at <hi>York</hi> in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced<note place="margin">His Deaht.</note> Age, and the Eighteenth Year of his Reign, of a very violent Malady, the Gout, after having ſubdued the Nations which were troubleſome to the Repoſe of that Country. He left Two Sons, <hi>Antoninus Baſſianus</hi> and <hi>Geta,</hi> to which latter he gave the ſame Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> in Honour of the Emperor <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antoninus.</hi> He was interred in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> for whom of all the Emperors, he had that Honour, and held his Memory ſo dear, that he conſecrated even his Son <hi>Commodus Antoninus</hi> a God, and thought that for the future, the Name of <hi>Antoninus</hi> ought to be inſeparable from the Perſon of the Emperor, as well as that of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> for ever. The Senate, his Children, and thoſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, joyned to make a magnificent Funeral
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52508:135"/> for him, and he was likewiſe enrolled in the Number of the Gods. The publick Works of his that are extant, are chiefly theſe; the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizonium,</hi> his Baths, and his <hi>Jani.</hi> The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was paſſed upon him after his Death was ſo much the more to his Honour, as his Son, and thoſe Princes that came after, proved unfortunate to the State; when all things were abandoned into the Hands of Robbers, that made a Prey of all the Grandeur and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Romans.</hi> He was ſo little curious of fine Cloaths, that his Veſt had ſcarce any Studs of Purple upon it; and over that, he wore a looſe ſhagged Coat. He eat little, and loved above all things the Peaſe, Beans, and Pulſe of his own Native Country; he ſometimes drank pretty freely; often quite abſtained from fleſh. He was handſome as to his Perſon; big, with<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</note> a long Beard; his Hair naturally curl'd; of an awful Countenance; a ſweet Voice, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an <hi>African</hi> Tone with it to the laſt. After his Death, he was more beloved than ever he had been during his Life; becauſe People then had ceaſed to envy him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were out of the fear of his Cruelty.</p>
                     <p>I remember, I have read in <hi>Aelius Maurus,</hi> the manumitted Servant of <hi>Phlegon</hi> of <hi>Tralles,</hi> that this Prince, when he died, rejoyced infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, that he left behind him two Sons of the Name of <hi>Antoninus</hi> to ſucceed in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and to be of equal Power with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after the Example of the Emperor <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Pius,</hi> who was ſucceeded at once by <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Verus Antoninus,</hi> who
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52508:135"/> yet being the Sons of that Prince but by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption; it pleaſed <hi>Severus</hi> ſo much the more, to think that his two Sons were his own, and derived of his own Blood; that is, <hi>Baſſianus Antoninus,</hi> whom he had by his firſt Wife, and <hi>Geta Antoninus,</hi> whom he had by <hi>Julia.</hi> But he was much miſtaken in his good hopes as to them both. The untimely Murder of the one, and the Vices of the other equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the State of reaping any Good by them.</p>
                     <p>And really when I have ſometime reflected upon this, I have with aſtoniſhment obſerved, may it pleaſe your Majeſty O <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> that ſeldom any of the great Men have ever left a good and an uſeful Son behind them. But either they have died all without Iſſue, or if they have had Children, their Children have been ſuch, that it had been better for their Glory to have left none at all. To begin with <hi>Romulus,</hi> he left the World no Children; nor <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> who were of any Service to the State. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Camillus?</hi> Had he any Children like himſelf? What had <hi>Scipio?</hi> What had the <hi>Cato's,</hi> who were all ſuch great Men? What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Homer, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes, Virgil, Saluſt, Terence, Plautus,</hi> and ſo many other excellent Perſons? What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Caeſar?</hi> What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Tully?</hi> but that it had been much better, that he had left no Children neither. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf? who had not a good even adoptive Son, though he had all the World to chuſe out of. <hi>Trajan</hi> was alſo miſtaken in the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52508:136"/> Choice that he made of his own Country man, and one of his own Blood. But to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any more adoptive Sons for the ſake of <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> who were Two ſuch Divinities: What had been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> if he had not left <hi>Commodus</hi> his Heir? what more Glorious than <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> if he had never begotten <hi>Baſſianus?</hi> who murdered his Brother, for a Crime maliciouſly invented by himſelf, and then charged it upon him who married his Mother-in-Law, who was as good as an own Mother to him, and in whoſe Arms he had before killed her Son, his Brother; who killed <hi>Papinian,</hi> that Sanctuary, that Treaſure of all the Doctrine of the Laws, only becauſe he would not juſtify ſo cruel a Fratricide Therefore in compariſon with this Son, <hi>Severus</hi> the Father, though he was in all Reſpects a hard, or rather a cruel Prince, was accounted Pious, and worthy of the Conſecration of a God; who as he lay on his Death-Bed, ſent, they ſay, to this his Son, that Divine Oration in <hi>Saluſt,</hi> of the King <hi>Micipſa</hi> to his Children. But it was ſo quite loſt upon <hi>Baſſianus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi> that he lived long in the hatred of the People, to whom although he gave a Bounty of thoſe Coats called <hi>Caracalla,</hi> from whence himſelf hath the Name of <hi>Caracallus;</hi> and though he built thoſe Baths of his Name, which are very Magnificent, yet that Holy and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Stile of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> became much the leſs beloved for his ſake. He, as we are told, built beſides the Portico which is at <hi>Rome,</hi> with
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52508:136"/> very great Splendor, in which there are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, the memorable Exploits of <hi>Severus</hi> his Father.</p>
                     <p>The Signs fore-running the Death of the<note place="margin">Signs fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running his Death.</note> Emperor <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> were theſe. He dreamt, that he was carried up to Heaven in a Chariot, drawn by four Eagles, and enrich'd with precious Stones, and I know not what large humane Form flying before him: that as he was elevated in the Air, he diſplay'd the Numbers Eighty Nine, beyond which Age pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely he did not live; for he was already old, when he came to the Empire. Then that he continued a long time alone and deſtitute of help, in a great Circle by himſelf, till at laſt, fearing to fall to Earth again, he ſaw himſelf called by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and placed amongſt the <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninuſſes.</hi> One day whilſt the Games of the Cirque were celebrating, as there were three Figures of Victory, with Palms in their hands placed according to Cuſtom upon the Platform where the Emperor's Throne is; that in the middle bearing a Globe, on which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Name of <hi>Severus,</hi> was blown down with a blaſt of Wind to the Ground, and there lay. The other, which was inſcribed with the Name of <hi>Geta,</hi> fell, and was broken to pieces; but that which was inſcribed with the Name of <hi>Baſſianus</hi> ſtood, but with much ado, and loſt its Palm-branch in the Wind. After he had finiſhed his Wall or Trench in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and was returning to the next Garriſon victorious, having hereby aſſured the Peace of that Country for ever, he was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52508:137"/> in his mind, what ſort of Omen he ſhould meet with upon it; a <hi>Black-moor</hi> who was of the Number of his Soldiers, and who was a famous Droll, always ready to make ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant piece of Rallery, preſents himſelf before him, with a Crown in his hand made of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; <hi>Severus</hi> in anger, commanded him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to retire out of his ſight, being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly touched with the double ill Omen of his Hew, and the Matter of his Crown.

                     <p>In a great many Cities there are Works<note place="margin">His pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Works.</note> which he ordered to be done, which are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; but particularly at <hi>Rome,</hi> all the publick Edifices which were decaying by old Age, and the courſe of time, he reſtored, and which was a great Action in him, without ſcarce ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing his own Name upon one of them, but every where continuing upon them the Names of their antient Founders. At his Death he left in the publick Stores, Corn to ſerve for Seven Years to come, at the rate of expending Seventy Five Thouſand <hi>Modii</hi> a day, whereof
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52508:137"/> each <hi>Modius</hi> was a Peck and half. And for Oyl, he left ſuch a Quantity, as was ſufficient not only for the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> but all <hi>Italy</hi> upon occaſion, for Five Years. They ſay that his laſt Words were theſe; <hi>I found the State when I received it, every where in Diſturbance. I leave it in Peace even to the</hi> Britains. <hi>Old and Lame, as I am, I leave the Empire firm to my Sons, if they are good: But in a feeble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for them, if they are bad.</hi> The laſt Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word which he ordered to be given to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, was, <hi>Laboremus,</hi> let us take Pains; as that of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> the firſt day that he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Empire, was, <hi>Militemus,</hi> let us fight. He had deſigned a ſecond Royal Image of Fortune to be made and added to that which always ſtands in the Emperor's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and is uſed to accompany them in all Places where they go; he deſired to leave of thoſe moſt ſacred Figures, to each of his Sons one. But when he found himſelf preſſed with the approaching hour of his Death, it is ſaid, he ordered that that Image of Fortune, which there was, ſhould be carried alternative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Chambers of his Two Sons; but <hi>Baſſianus Antoninus</hi> ſlighted that Order, even before he had killed his Brother.</p>
                     <p>His Body was brought from <hi>Great Britain</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where it was received with the greateſt Reverence of all the Provinces; though ſome ſay, it was only his Aſhes which were brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> repoſed in a little Urn of Gold, which was interred in the Sepulchre of the <hi>Antoninuſſes;</hi> and that the Body was burnt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52508:138"/> the place where he died. When he built the <hi>Septizonium,</hi> he had no other Deſign in it, but to make appear the Magnificence of his Work, to the Eyes of thoſe, who particularly ſhould come out of his Native Country of <hi>Africa;</hi> and if he had not been prevented, it is ſuppoſed, he would have made a ſtately <hi>Intrado</hi> from thence to the Palace Royal; as afterward the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> would have done, but that the Soothſayers prohibited him, for Reaſons in their Art.</p>

                     <p>After the Death of <hi>Commodus,</hi> and the Death alſo of his Succeſſor <hi>Pertinax, Peſcennius Niger</hi> ſet up for the Empire upon the Authority of the ſame Forces of <hi>Syria;</hi> encouraged to it from <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Didius Julianus,</hi> who had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Pertinax,</hi> was ſo hated by the People, that they publickly curſed him, and threw Stones at him, and prayed, that the Gods would give them <hi>Niger</hi> to be their Prince, and <hi>Niger</hi> to come to the Succour of the City. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Julianus</hi> ſent a Centurion with Orders to bring him the Head of <hi>Niger,</hi> which was a very imprudent Fancy indeed, as if it was ſuch an eaſie matter for a ſingle Centurion to make himſelf the Maſter of one, who was at the Head of a puiſſant Army, and could very well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf. With the ſame imprudence it was that he propoſed to take off the Head of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> after he had already been declared Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and to ſend a Man to command in his place. For he had ſent the known Aſſaſſine, <hi>Aquilius</hi> a Centurion, to him to kill him; as if ſo powerful a General, was ſo eaſily to be killed by a Centurion. But yet all this was as Judicious, as his pretending to prohibit <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> from the Empire by Law, becauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was in the prior Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Inclinations of the People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by the People</note> 
                        <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> and their averſion to <hi>Julianus,</hi> appeared ſufficiently in this; that whilſt <hi>Julianus</hi> was Entertaining them with the Games of the Cirque; even then, they called upon the Name of <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> and wiſhed publickly for his coming to the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52508:140"/> Succour of the City.

                     <p>Now in the time that <hi>Severus</hi> was the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant<note place="margin">

And certainly he was a very good Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and underſtood the Diſcipline of War perfectly well. He never ſuffered his Men to extort from their Quarters in the Provinces, Wood or Oyl, or any manner of Service. He never made Gain to himſelf out of their Pay; nor when he was a Tribune, did he ſuffer the other Officers to do ſo: And after he was ſet up to be Emperor, he commanded two Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes who were guilty of making Advantages to themſelves out of the Pay of their Soldiers, to be ſtoned to Death.</p>

                        <hi>Severus</hi> ſays in his own Life, that before that his Sons were come to be of an Age to ſucceed him, he had intended when he was ſick, if he had died, to appoint before all others <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> and <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> to be his Succeſſors; though afterwards they were both the one and the other his greateſt Enemies. But however, this is an Argument of the good Opinion that once <hi>Severus</hi> had of <hi>Niger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we may believe <hi>Severus, Peſcennius Niger</hi> was a Man ambitious of Glory, of a Life cloſe and reſerved, and of an advanced Age, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

At the ſame time that <hi>Severus</hi> ſent <hi>Heraclius</hi> into <hi>Bithynia</hi> to ſecure that Country, he ſent <hi>Fulvius</hi> to go and get into his Cuſtody the Children of <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> who were then in the Flower of their Youth. He took no notice at all of their Father to the Senate, but immediately began an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to compoſe the State of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> But withal, he commanded ſome Legions into <hi>Africa,</hi> to prevent that <hi>Niger</hi> ſhould not poſſeſs himſelf of that Quarter, and thereby afflict the People of <hi>Rome</hi> with a want of the Corn from thence. For though the Paſſage both by Sea and Land was difficult, yet it did not ſeem impoſſible for <hi>Niger</hi> to do this, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he took his way through the Countries of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Libya.</hi>

In the Arch of the Gallery which is in the Gardens of <hi>Commodus,</hi> we have to this day his Picture done in <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work, amongſt the great Friends of that Prince, aſſiſting at the Myſteries of the Goddeſs <hi>Iſis.

                     <p>We may ſee how conſiderable a Man he was by this; that his Authority and his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit at the Court was ſo great, that he writ firſt to the Emperor <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Commodus,</hi> when he perceived how much the Provinces were ruined by
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52508:143"/> making too frequent changes in the Perſons who governed them; that in the firſt place, no Preſident, or Lieutenant, or Proconſul of<note place="margin">His Skill in Civil Affairs.</note> a Province ſhould be ſucceeded by another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the term of Five Years; that when that term was expired, the ſaid Magiſtrates ſhould give an Account, how they had adminiſtred the Power which they had been intruſted with; and then that no Perſons who were not of good Extractions, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſerve in thoſe high Offices of State. Beſides this, it was a ſuggeſtion of his, that the Aſſeſſors attending upon the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and other Magiſtrates of the Provinces, to aſſiſt them in Counſel, ſhould be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their turns unto the higheſt Honours; which was obſerved afterwards by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Severus,</hi> and thenceforward by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as appears by the Examples of <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Ulpian,</hi> who had been both Aſſeſſors to <hi>Papinian,</hi> and were both of them afterwards, firſt employed in the Office of Secretaries, the one for the Diſpatches, the other for the Regiſters, and then ſoon after they were made the Captains of the Guards. It is alſo from him that no body is an Aſſeſſor to a Judge, but in his own Province; and that no one admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that Charge at <hi>Rome,</hi> but what is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the City. He added beſides, that there ſhould be Salaries appointed for certain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, that they might not be a Charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who were the Aſſeſſors, becauſe a Judge (he ſaid) was neither to give nor take any thing. As for the Soldiers, he was ſo
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52508:143"/> ſtrict upon thoſe, that when ſome of them<note place="margin">And Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> who were in Garriſon upon the Frontiers in <hi>Egypt</hi> had asked him for ſome Wine, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>You have the River</hi> Nile <hi>there, and do you ask me for Wine?</hi> And certainly, the Water of that River is ſo ſweet and ſo pleaſant, that thoſe of the Country have no deſire at all to drink Wine. Others that had been beaten by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> murmuring, and being upon the point of a Sedition, ſaying, <hi>We have had no Wine to drink, we cannot Fight.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>For ſhame, when thoſe that beat you drink Water!</hi> The People of the Province of <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Tax which was upon their Lands might be abated, becauſe they cried they were overcharged; he made them Anſwer, <hi>You would have the Tax taken off of your Lands, but I will tax your very Air that you breath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>During that great Commotion of the State, when there were three Emperors ſet up at one and the ſame time, that is, <hi>Septimus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus, Peſcennius Niger,</hi> and <hi>Clodius Albinus;</hi> the Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> was conſulted, which of them would be the beſt for the Publick to carry it. The Oracle anſwered in ſome obſcure Words in Greek, but which were underſtood to ſignify, that <hi>Niger</hi> was the beſt, <hi>Severus</hi> was well enough, and <hi>Albinus</hi> the worſt of the Three. After this, their Curioſity lead them to ask the Oracle, which of the Three then ſhould be the Perſon that ſhould at laſt carry it; the Anſwer was to this effect, <hi>That the White and the Black,</hi> that is, Albinus <hi>and</hi> Niger <hi>ſhould be killed, and an</hi> African <hi>born</hi> (which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52508:144"/> 
                        <hi>Severus</hi> was) <hi>ſhould poſſeſs the Empire of the World.</hi> Then they asked further, who ſhould ſucceed that <hi>African,</hi> the Oracle anſwered, <hi>That he ſhould be one, who was of the Name of the</hi> Pious. Which was not at all underſtood, till <hi>Baſſianus</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Severus</hi> aſſumed the Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> who was the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Title of the <hi>Pious,</hi> and then it was concluded to be meant of <hi>Baſſianus.</hi> Laſtly, it was asked, how long a time he, who of the Three Competitors carried the Empire, ſhould Reign; and the Anſwer was to this effect,</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>In twice ten Ships he'll ride the <hi>Italian</hi> Sea,</l>
                        <l>Or from that Sail, let one deducted be.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>That is, underſtanding by the <hi>Italian</hi> Sea, the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth; it ſignified very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Severus</hi> ſhould, as he did, Reign about Ninetten or Twenty Years.</p>
                     <p>This is what I humbly preſent before your Majeſty, O <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> who are the greateſt of Emperors, concerning <hi>Peſcennius Niger.</hi> I have collected it for the purpoſe out of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Writings, wherein he comes to be but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally mentioned. For as for the entire Lives of Perſons, who either have not actually reigned, or have not been declared Emperor by the Senate, or perhaps have been killed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have eſtabliſh'd their Fame in the World, it is ſeldom, as I ſaid in the beginning, that any body dares to write them. Which is the reaſon that we have none of the Life of <hi>Vindex,</hi> and that we know nothing of the Life of <hi>Piſo;</hi> nor almoſt of all thoſe who either
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52508:144"/> have been only adopted to be <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and no more, or have been barely ſaluted Emperors by the Soldiers, and no more, as <hi>Anthony</hi> was under <hi>Domitian;</hi> or by being betimes killed, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ended their Uſurpations, and their Lives together. But yet that I may not ſeem to omit any thing here, of what relates to this Perſon, that I can any where find, the Aſtrologers made this Remark upon him; that neither living nor dead, ſhould he fall into the hands of <hi>Severus,</hi> but that he ſhould periſh by the ſide of a Water. Some ſay, <hi>Severus</hi> himſelf had ſaid this of him, by his own Skill in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities. Nor was the Prognoſtication void altogether of Truth, for he was found half a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and half dead by a Lake.</p>
                     <p>He had one day obſerved ſome Soldiers in<note place="margin">His ſtrict Orders.</note> an Expedition, drinking out of a Cup of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; whereupon he was ſo ſtrict, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that all Silver at ſuch times ſhould be caſt out of uſe, and that they ſhould drink out of Veſſels of Wood; which however, they did not very well like, becauſe he ſaid, it may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be, that the Baggage may fall into the Power of the Enemy; and he would not have it, that the Barbarians ſhould find any ſuch opportunity to ſet themſelves off with our Silver, when there are other things to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, which if taken, will give them a leſs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Glory. He ordered, that no Man upon an Expedition ſhould drink Wine, but that all ſhould content themſelves upon a day of Battel with Vinegar. He forbad <hi>Bakers</hi> to follow the Army, being not willing that the Soldiers
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52508:145"/> ſhould eat any thing that day but Bisket. For the ſtealing of one Pullet, he had ordered Ten Comerades, that were at the eating of it, tho' only one of them had ſtoln it, to loſe their Heads; which had certainly been execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that all the Army interpoſed for them, in a manner ſo high, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in a Mutiny; to prevent which, he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated his Sentence, and ordered, that the Ten that had eaten together of the Theft, ſhould pay to the Country-man the Price of Ten Pullets, for that One that he had loſt. He ſuffered them not to make Fires to get themſelves any hot Meat, but cauſed them to be contented with dry Bread on ſomething that was cold, and ſet Spies upon them, to ſee that it was juſtly obſerved. He for bad the Soldiers, when they went to Battel, to keep any Gold or Silver about them in their Pockets, but to truſt it in ſuch ſafe and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hands, as ſhould reſtore it again to them faithfully, after the Battel was over; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pay it to their Children, or Wives and Executors, who ſhould come to demand it; becauſe if any Blow of Fortune ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, yet he would have no Booty to fall into the hand of the Enemy All which Orders, by reaſon of the diſſoluteneſs of the times of <hi>Commodus,</hi> gained him then but only ſo much the more ill will. For though no Man made an exacter Commander in his time, than he, yet it redounded rather to his prejudice, till after his Death; when Envy and Malice being laid aſide, ſuch ſort of Examples were valued.</p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:52508:145"/>
                     <p>Upon every Expedition that he took, he<note place="margin">His perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</note> eat himſelf of the Soldiers Amunition-Bread, and Victuals in publick. He never wore any thing upon his Head to cover him, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sun, or againſt the Rain, in which he had no Perſons like him. He ſet before them all an Example of Induſtry in himſelf and his Servants. For he impoſed Burdens of things upon the backs of his Servants, becauſe they ſhould not appear to walk at their eaſe, whilſt the Soldiers were loaded, which might make them envy them. He proteſted in a Speech that he made to them, that as long as he had been, or ſhould be ever employed in the occaſions of War, he ſhould behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as freely with them, as if he was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man: having always <hi>Marius</hi> and ſuch great Generals as he before his Eyes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Diſcourſes always of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the like. When a certain Perſon would have recited a Panegyric before him, upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaluted Emperor, he ſaid to him, <hi>Write the Praiſes of</hi> Marius <hi>or</hi> Hannibal, <hi>or ſome ſuch excellent Captain that is dead; and tell us what he hath done, for us to imitate him in: But to praiſe the Living is a Jeſt, eſpecially Emperors; from whom there are expectatiosn of all things on the one hand, and fears on the other. They can reward, protect, kill, proſcribe; as for me, I deſire only to pleaſe while I live; when I am dead, then praiſe me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Above all the Emperors, he loved <hi>Auguſtus, Veſpaſian, Titus, Trajan, Antoninus Pius,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antoninus.</hi> The reſt, he ſaid, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52508:146"/> effeminate and ſhadows of Emperors, or they were Vipers. He always was particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed with the Accounts in Hiſtory of <hi>Camillus, Marius,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Martius Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus.</hi> Being asked what he thought of the <hi>Scipio's;</hi> he ſaid, <hi>They were rather happy Men, than great Captains;</hi> which he proved by their domeſtick Lives and their Youths, which were too looſe and too eaſie in the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore it is a thing very evident, that if <hi>Peſeennius Niger</hi> had gained, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enjoyed the Empire, he was one who would have amended all things, which <hi>Sever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>i</hi> either could not, or he would not amend; and all this without Cruelty. He would have done it, on the contrary, with great ſweetneſs, and yet in a manner becoming a Soldier, and with out that lenity that is fooliſh and ridiculous. His Houſe is to be ſeen at this day at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>Campus Jovis,</hi> retaining his Name; in which, in one of the Rooms is his Statue, which was ſet up by <hi>Statius Poſtumius</hi> in the black Marble of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who had received it from the King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who had cauſed it to be done to the Life. Upon the Baſis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is written an Epigram in Greek to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <hi>Here ſtands the Great</hi> Niger, <hi>the Terror of Egypt, the Allie of</hi> Thebes, <hi>who had propoſed a Golden Age to all. Kings, Nations,</hi> Rome <hi>it ſelf loved him. He was dear to the</hi> Antoninus'<hi>s, and to the whole Empire. As his Name was</hi> Niger, (that is, Black) <hi>ſo we have faſhioned him in Black, that the Statue and the Perſon ſhould cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond. Severus</hi> would never ſuffer this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52508:146"/> to be eraſed, altho' the Captains of his Guards, and others of his great Officers adviſed him to it. <hi>For,</hi> ſave he, <hi>if</hi> Peſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Niger <hi>was ſo great a Potentate as this makes him, let the World know what a Man we have conquered; if he was not, let them however think, that we have conquered ſuch a Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It remains, that now I proceed to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Clodius Albinus,</hi> who was as it were the Companion of this Perſon, both in his Riſe and Fall. For they both in effect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted about the ſame time againſt <hi>Severus,</hi> and were both of them overcome and killed by <hi>Severus.</hi> But though the Fortune of <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> was much what the ſame, and ran pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with this of <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> yet his Life was ſufficiently different.</p>

                     <p>But however, upon the receipt of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> would by no means offer to take upon him to do what <hi>Commodus</hi> had appointed him, becauſe he was afraid of the Odium that <hi>Commodus</hi> was in, by reaſon of his Manners, by which he ruined the State, and diſhonoured it from day to day, killing the People with both Hands; and becauſe he was afraid beſides of being found ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the number of thoſe whom he ſhould order to the ſame Maſſacre.

                     <p>Nor can it be denied, but that <hi>Severus</hi> did at firſt intend, as <hi>Marius Maximus</hi> ſays, if he had died early, to ſubſtitute <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52508:149"/> 
                        <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> to be his Succeſſors. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own Sons growing up, whoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes he had a deſire to make, and envying <hi>Albinus</hi> the love which he had amongſt the Senators; he changed thoſe Sentiments, and oppreſſed both <hi>Albinus</hi> and <hi>Niger</hi> by a War, upon which he was more eſpecially urged by the Entreaties of his Wife. This beſides he had done for <hi>Albinus,</hi> he made him a Conſul, which if he had not believed him to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Perſon, without doubt he would never have done; ſo very careful as he was, in the choice that he made of the publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the beginning of his Story, <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> was born, as I ſaid, at the Town of <hi>Mahometa;</hi> but yet that which made him Honourable in the Eyes of all who knew him, was, that he derived his Deſcent from the <hi>Roman</hi> Family of the <hi>Poſt humii,</hi> and the <hi>Albini Cejonii,</hi> which is at this day very Noble, and hath been much augmented by the Benefactions of your moſt excellent Majeſty, O <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and there is reaſon to believe, that your Majeſty will augment it yet much more, as formerly it received a great encreaſe from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors <hi>Gallienus</hi> and the <hi>Gordiani.</hi> He was born but to a very ſmall Patrimony, of a Father, who was called <hi>Cejonius Poſt humius,</hi> and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called <hi>Aurelia Meſſalina,</hi> to whom he was their firſt Child.

                     <p>He paſſed all his Infancy in <hi>Africa,</hi> took his Greek and Latin Learning pretty well, but had a Martial Heart, and was of a haughty Diſpoſition by Nature. Amongſt the little Boys of his Age, at School, he was often, they ſay, ſinging that Verſe of <hi>Virgil,</hi> 
                        <q>Arma amens capio, nec ſat rationis in armis.</q> repeating, eſpecially the firſt part of it, <hi>Arma amens capio,</hi> that is, <hi>I am for being a Soldier right or wrong, and come what will.</hi> They ſay,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:52508:150"/> that ſeveral things happened after his Birth, which were ſo many Omens of his future<note place="margin">Omens of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Greatneſs. And certainly the ſame day there was born a Calf as white as Snow, with Horns upon his Head, of a deep purple; which Horns were a long time afterwards to be ſeen in the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> at the City of <hi>Cumae,</hi> where himſelf had beſtowed them, when he was a Tribune. Enquiring at the ſame Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple one day of the Oracle about his Fortune, he was anſwered in theſe Verſes of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Hic rem Romanam magno turbante tumultu</l>

                     </lg>
                     <p>Accordingly, it is very true, as to what the latter Verſe ſays of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> that <hi>Clodius Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus</hi> did ſubdue many Nations of them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Omen was this; whilſt he was a little Infant, a Fiſher-man happened to take a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe which was of a very great bigneſs, and made a preſent of it to <hi>Albinus</hi>'s Father; who being a Perſon of ſome Learning, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it as a good Sign, accepted it, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Shell of it to be kept, and ſet apart for the uſe of his young Son to waſh in; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a peculiar Cuſtom in the Imperial Family, for the young Princes to waſh in Shells of Tortoiſes. It was a rare thing, to ſee Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles in that place, where <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> was born; and yet upon the ſeventh Day after, which was appointed for the Solemnity of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him his Name, ſeven young Eagles were taken out of a Neſt, and brought to the ſide
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:52508:150"/> of his Cradle; which his Father, not rejecting the good omen, ordered to be well kept, and that they ſhould take great care of them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things therefore, and ſuch others that occurred, were ſo many aſſured Preſages of his future Elevation; which are more particularly purſued by <hi>Aelius Cordus;</hi> to whom I muſt refer the Reader, if he ſhall deſire any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>He betook himſelf to the Army early in his Youth; and became known to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors the <hi>Antoninuſſes,</hi> by the means of <hi>Lollius Serenus, Baebius Maetianus,</hi> and <hi>Cejonius Poſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus,</hi> who were all related to him.

All which he prudently, and with great ſatisfaction declined, as if he ſuſpected, that <hi>Commodus</hi>'s deſign was only to find Perſons, whom to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve in his own ruin, and whom to Maſſacre under ſome ſort of pretence.</p>

                     <p>Now the Perſons who were ſent with this Letter by <hi>Severus,</hi> being ſuch as had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Affection for his Service, ſo that he knew he could confide in them; he ordered them to delivered it to <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> in Publick: but when they had done, they ſhould ſay, that<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Treachery of</hi> Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note> they deſired privately to ſpeak to him about ſome things, which were of the ſecrets of the Camp and the Court. And having taken him aſide, as if it were only to deliver what they were charged with, five ſtrong Men of their
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52508:152"/> Retinue, having Ponyards hid under their Robes, ſhould fall upon him and kill him. And certainly they did not betray the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence impoſed in them; nor were wanting in their Endeavours to execute their Orders. For when they were come to <hi>Albinus,</hi> and had given him the Letter, which he Read, and had told him that they had ſome other things in particular to diſcover to him, which were to be ſpoken more privately, he took them apart into a long Gallery; but in the mean time they were ſo over-careful that no other Perſons ſhould follow them, pretending as if it were out of a fear leſt their Meſſage ſhould be diſcovered, that <hi>Albinus</hi> began to ſuſpect ſomething; upon which he immediately cauſed them to be ſeized, and put them to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Who at firſt denyed it; but being at laſt forced to yield to the violence of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they confeſſed then all that <hi>Severus</hi> had given in Charge to them. Wherefore, <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> being ſatisfied in the juſt ſuſpition that he had conceived, gathered together a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and put himſelf upon his March with them to make War againſt <hi>Severus,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Commanders.</p>
                     <p>In his firſt Engagement which he had with the Lieutenants of <hi>Severus, Albinus</hi> had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the better of it. After which <hi>Severus</hi> went in Perſon againſt him, having firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the Senate to adjudge him an Enemy. They fought it very ſeverely on both ſides, in <hi>Gallia,</hi> not without always a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Fortune: inſomuch that <hi>Severus</hi> was
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52508:152"/> ſo concerned at it, that he thought fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Opinion of the <hi>Augurs;</hi> who anſwered him, as <hi>Marius Maximus</hi> ſays, that <hi>Clodius Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus</hi> ſhould indeed fall into his Power, but it ſhould be neither living nor dead; and it was ſo. For when the laſt Battel was fought, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,</hi> after an infinite number of his Men were killed, a great many others put to flight, and others taken Priſoners, fled himſelf; and whether it was that he ſtruck himſelf through the Body, or whether, as ſome ſay, one of his own Slaves, or ſome of the Soldiers did it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ſome acknowledgment from him of <hi>Severus,</hi> I cannot ſay; but he was brought half alive, and half dead to <hi>Severus;</hi> which made good the Prediction. He left one Son, or as <hi>Maximus</hi> ſays two; to whom at the firſt <hi>Severus</hi> was pleaſed to ſhew favour; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ordered them and their Mother to be kill'd, and their Bodies to be thrown into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The Head of <hi>Albinus</hi> was cut off, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about upon a Javelin, and then ſent to <hi>Rome;</hi> accompanied with Letters to the Senate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Severus</hi> inſulted them for the Affection which they had a long time born to <hi>Albinus,</hi> and for the Honours and Kindneſſes that they had ſhewn to his Brother and his Relations: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially his Brother. His Body was expoſed in its Gore for ſeveral days before the Tent of <hi>Severus,</hi> till it ſtunk, and then it was torn into pieces by Dogs, and thrown into the River.</p>
                     <p>As for the Manners of <hi>Clodius Albinus,</hi> they<note place="margin">His Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Manners.</note> are repreſented variouſly. <hi>Severus</hi> ſays, he was deformed with Vices; Malicious, Lewd, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52508:153"/> Diſhoneſt, Envious, and Luxurious. But it is to be obſerved, that it was in the time of the War with him, or after, that he ſpeaks ſo ill of him, which makes it the leſs to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Becauſe before, he frequently ſent Letters to him as his particular Friend, and certainly many People had a much better Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than that of him. Beſides, that <hi>Severus</hi> himſelf, had once called him his <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and had ſet him the firſt before his Eyes for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.

                              <hi>THE Fidelity of</hi> Albinus <hi>is to be commended: who when the Forces in</hi> Bithynia <hi>were upon the Revolt, and upon flying over to</hi> Avidius Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, <hi>(as certainly they had all done, if he had not been with them) was very careful in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them in their Duty.

                     <p>Theſe two Letters therefore make it appear that <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> was an uſeful Perſon. And certainly his ſending of Money towards the reſtoration of thoſe Cities, which had been laid waſte by <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> is another great Argument of a Publick Spirit, and what had gained him Friends amongſt the Inhabitants there. <hi>Aelius Cordus,</hi> pretends at the ſame time to ſay, that he was ſuch a Glutton, that particularly he would eat more Fruit at a time, than it is poſſible to imagine. He ſays,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52508:154"/> that he has eaten, at a Breakfaſt five hundred Figs, one hundred Peaches, ten Melons, twenty Bunches of Grapes, a hundred of the little Birds called <hi>Beccafico's</hi> or Fig-Peckers, and four hundred Oiſters. But yet he ſays that he drank but little; in which <hi>Severus</hi> does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him: for he tells us that he drank to exceſs, even in the time of the War. And whether it was becauſe of this his great drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which <hi>Severus</hi> charges him with; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Moroſeneſs of Humour, it is ſaid, he never lived well with his Family: but was very diſagreeable to his Wife, and unjuſt to his Servants; as well as hard upon the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. As to which latter, he many times crucified Centurions, when there hath been as good as no occaſion given for it. He beat others often with Rods, and pardoned not the leaſt fault. He was proper in his Cloaths, and as improper in his Repaſts; in which he minded nothing but Abundance. He was a great lover of a Miſtreſs, but not at all of a Bardaccio; being ſo far from that, that he ſeverely puniſhed it upon ſuch as were. He was perfectly well skilled in Agriculture; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he writ a Book of <hi>Georgicks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was as much beloved by the Senate as any Prince ever was: but the great occaſion of it was; their mortal hatred to <hi>Severus,</hi> which they had againſt him upon the account of his Cruelty. Therefore as many of them, as either were, or ſuch as were but ſuſpected to have been of <hi>Albinus</hi>'s ſide, he put to death after the Victory. He ordered the Letters of <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:52508:154"/> to be ſearched, to diſcover his Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: and all that he found whatever, he firſt cauſed them to be declared Enemies by the Senate; then put them without mercy to death, and Confiſcated their Eſtates into the Treaſury.</p>
                     <p>There is a Letter, which he writ to the Senate, that ſhews his very Soul, as to theſe things; a Copy whereof is as follows.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                        <body>
                           <p>CAN any thing oblige me more, Fathers of the Senate, than to hear that <hi>Albinus</hi> ſhould have your good Opinions, rather than <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus.</hi> With great care I have furniſhed the State with Corn, and have maintained ſeveral Wars for the State, and have ſupplied the People of <hi>Rome</hi> with more Oil than the World ſcarce ever beheld: and by my overcoming <hi>Peſcennius Niger</hi> I have delivered you from the miſeries of a Tyranny. Indeed you have made on your part a great return to me for all this. For here's a Man, who is not only an <hi>African</hi> as my ſelf, but one of the poor Town of <hi>Mahometa,</hi> and only becauſe he pretends to derive his blood from the <hi>Roman Cejonii,</hi> you have extolled him ſo far, that you would have him to be your Emperor, whilſt as yet I am upon the Throne, and my ſelf and my Children are in ſafety. Was the noble Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate at a loſs I pray, for a Prince whom you ought to love, and who loves you? Becauſe from this Man you hope perhaps to be made Conſuls, to be made Praetors, and what not, therefore you
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52508:155"/> have for your better Intereſts in him conferred Honours upon his Brother. Which is not to make that return to me, as was formerly done by your Anceſtors againſt the Faction of <hi>Piſo;</hi> nor as it was lately done to the Emperor <hi>Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> againſt the Rebellion of <hi>Avidius Caſſius.</hi> But you have preferred a Man to me, who is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, who tells you nothing but lies, and does but impoſe upon you in the matter of his Nobility. <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius Corfulenus</hi> undoubtedly muſt be heard by the Senate to his Motion, that they would pleaſe to decree ſome Honours to <hi>Albinus,</hi> and to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the mean time I ſhould think, that that Noble Perſon had forgot himſelf, that he did not decree a Triumph for me in my turn. It troubles me more than all, that ſo many amongſt you ſhould think that <hi>Albinus</hi> is to be commended for a Man of Letters, who ſpent all his time in <hi>Apuleius,</hi> and thoſe Ludicrous Pieces, which are no better than ſome Ditties of the old Wives.</p>

                     <p>By this it is to be ſeen how eager <hi>Severus</hi> was, and how he always blamed the Factions both of <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> and of <hi>Clodius Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> of all which, if any one deſires a more particular account, let him read <hi>Marius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> for the Writers in the Latin Tongue, and <hi>Herodian</hi> for the <hi>Greek,</hi> who have delivered a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52508:155"/> 
                        <hi>Albinus,</hi> from nothing elſe. He had an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Voice, as ſhrill almoſt as an Eunuchs. He had an eaſie meen; but yet he was ill to be angred, and worſe to be oppoſed. He was changeable in his Luxury; for many times he would Drink, and many times again Abſtain. He was perfectly brave for Arms; one may, not improperly, call him the <hi>Catiline</hi> of his time. As for what remains, it will not, I think, be amiſs to ſhew how it was that he gain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<note place="margin">Reaſon of his Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</note> ſo much of the love of the Senate. Whilſt he Commanded the Army in <hi>Great Britain</hi> by the orders of <hi>Commodus,</hi> a Report came, but yet it was falſe at that time, that that Prince was killed; upon which occaſion he came to the Head of the Army, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued them thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the Senate, and the People of</hi> Rome <hi>had evermore retained their antient Empire; and that a State ſo great had never been ſubmitted to the power of a ſingle Perſon, there had been no</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius, <hi>no</hi> Nero, <hi>no</hi> Domitian, <hi>to have fallen by the Stroke of an Aſſaſſine. And then it was during the time of the Conſular Government, that thoſe Families flouriſhed, of the</hi> Cejonii, <hi>the</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bini, <hi>and the</hi> Poſthumii: <hi>of whom your Fathers have many things to ſay, which they have heard from their Grandfathers before them. Certainly it was the Senate that annexed</hi> Africa <hi>to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Empire. The Senate ſubdued</hi> Gallia <hi>and</hi> Spain. <hi>The Senate gave Laws to the Provinces of the Eaſt. The Senate had often attempted the</hi>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:52508:156"/> Parthians, <hi>and had reduced them, if ſo Covetous a General as</hi> Craſſus; <hi>had not then been at the Head of the</hi> Roman <hi>Army. It was when</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar <hi>was a Senator; that he conquered</hi> Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: <hi>at leaſt he had not been declared Dictator then. And how much better had it been for</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus <hi>himſelf, if he had ſtood in fear of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Their Authority held good, as far as to the times of</hi> Nero; <hi>being not afraid to Condemn that ſordid and impure Prince, nor to pronounce their Judgments againſt him, though he then had the full Power of Life and Death in his hands. Wherefore, my Fellow Soldiers; I for my part, who have had the Title of</hi> Caeſar <hi>conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me by</hi> Commodus, <hi>renounce that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Gods grant that others may do ſo too. Let the Senate Reign, and diſtribute the Provinces. Let the Senate make us Conſuls: or why do I ſay the Senate? Let your ſelves, and your Fathers.

                     <p>This Speech was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt <hi>Commodus</hi> was yet living; who was ſo moved by it againſt the Author, that he preſently ſent to turn him out, and gave his Place to <hi>Junius Severus,</hi> who was one of his Guards.

                     <p>THE Emperor <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> left two Sons, <hi>Baſſianus</hi> and <hi>Geta.</hi> The firſt and eldeſt had the name given him of <hi>Baſſianus Antoninus,</hi> and was Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a <hi>Caeſar</hi> by his Father; the other had the name given him of <hi>Geta Antoninus,</hi> and was declared a <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the Army. The firſt ſucceeded to enjoy the Throne; the other was quickly adjudged an Enemy, and murdered by his Brother: concerning whoſe Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors I think it in vain to make any repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, becauſe I have ſaid enough upon that Head, in the account of the Life of their Father.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Baſſianus Antoninus</hi> was when he was a youth<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter when a Youth.</note> and under the Tutelage of his Parents, endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ingenious, dutiful to them, obliging to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, acceptable to the People, and to the Senate, and ready to offer at any thing to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate himſelf. He was not ſlow at his Learning. He was not ſparing of his Bounty. He was not negligent in giving Marks of his Clemency. If he was preſent, whenever any condemned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were thrown to the Beaſts, he either wept, or turned away his Eyes from the Sight, which was an extraordinary pleaſing thing to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When he was a Boy of ſeven Years old, and ſaw another Boy who was his Play-fellow beaten ſeverely for making profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, he was a long time out of humour both with his own, and with the Boy's Father, and all ſuch as were the occaſion of the Boy's beating. He obtained that the Cities of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould be reſtored to their antient Rights, by his interpoſition in their behalf with his Father, under whoſe diſpleaſure they had faln, for aſſiſting in the Rebellion of <hi>Peſcennius Niger.</hi> He con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:52508:158"/> he thought to equalize himſelf with <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he turned very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and grave, and affected ſuch a fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Countenance, that many who knew him a Boy, could ſcarce believe him to be the ſame Perſon. He had always <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> in his Mouth. He was often in publick Company praiſing <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Sylla.</hi> He was prouder than his Father, who was one that was high enough, and he deſpiſed his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Geta,</hi> becauſe of his great Modeſty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the Death of his Father, he came to the Camp of the Guards, and complained that <hi>Geta</hi> had been in a Conſpiracy againſt him, for which he had cauſed him to be put to death<note place="margin">Puts his Brother to death.</note> in the Palace, and his Body to be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burnt. He told them particularly, that he had deſigned to poyſon him, and that he had been undutiful alſo to his Mother; concluding, that to engage them to be the more faithful to himſelf, he preſented them with a Bounty. There was another encampment at this time, near the City of <hi>Albano,</hi> where the Murder of <hi>Geta</hi> was highly reſented; all the Soldiers ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as it was to both the Sons of <hi>Severus</hi> equally, that they promiſed Fidelity, ſo they ought to keep to them both, refuſing to open their Gates; ſo that <hi>Baſſianus</hi> was a long time in getting entrance to them, nor could he cool them at laſt, but with the fineſt words and promiſes of what a prodigious Bounty he would give them, as this way ſeldom fails of quieting the Heats of Soldiers. From thence he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he came to the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52508:159"/> Senate in a Cuiraſs under his Robes, and his Soldiers in Arms guarding him, whom he placed in Files in the middle betwixt the Seats, and made his Speech; in which he much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the evil deſigns of his Brother againſt his Life, to whom he ſaid, to charge his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and excuſe himſelf, he had been ſo kind, and that he had denied him nothing, and had delivered him from the dangers that he had been in; but inſtead of having a due Senſe of theſe Favours, he had attempted his Life, and had not anſwered his good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But yet he uttered all this confuſedly, and with ſuch an ill Grace, that the Senate did not very well accept what he ſaid.</p>
                     <p>After this Speech, he declared, that it was his pleaſure to reſtore all that were in exile to the Liberties of their Country again; and then from the Senate he return'd to the Guards, and lay in the Camp. The next day he came to the Capitol; from the Capitol he repair'd to the Palace-Royal, ſupported by <hi>Papinian</hi> and <hi>Chilo.</hi> In the mean time, thoſe that he had a deſign to murder, he beſpoke himſelf the moſt kindly to. He had obſerved the Mother of <hi>Geta,</hi> with other Women, weeping bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had it not been that he was reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Senſe, that it would make the Cruelty of his Brother's Murder look much worſe, he was for putting them all to Death. He ſent Poyſon to <hi>Laetus,</hi> and obliged him to take it; who, as he was the firſt of thoſe that had perſuaded him to the Murder of <hi>Geta,</hi> was the firſt that fell a Sacrifice to his Ghoſt.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:52508:159"/> He afterwards often pretended to lament <hi>Geta</hi>'s Death, and killed ſeveral that had been privy to it, and honoured his Memory and his Image. He had ſent a Preſent to one, that was his Couſin-German, an <hi>African</hi> by Nation, but the day before that he ordered him to killed; who throwing himſelf down from a Window to eſcape his Perſecutors, broke his Leg, but yet had crept to his Wife, where they took him, and afterwards made a very ſport of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him. He put to death <hi>Pompeianus,</hi> the<note place="margin">His many Cruelties.</note> Grandſon of the Emperor <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> and the Son of that <hi>Pompeianus,</hi> to whom <hi>Lucilla</hi> married, after the Death of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Verus,</hi> who had made him a Conſul twice, and had intruſted him with the Command of his Armies in all his Wars. The way which he took to do this Murder, was, he ordered him to be ſet upon as it were by Thieves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Papinian</hi> was executed in his preſence by the Soldiers, with an Axe; and after it was done, he ſaid to the Murderer, <hi>You ought according to my Order, to have done it with a Sword. Petronius</hi> was killed by his Command before the Temple of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> and both the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the one and the other were dragged about the Streets, without any regard to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. He put to death the Son of <hi>Papinian,</hi> who but three days before had treated the City with a magnificent Shew, upon his entrance into the Office of a Queſtor. An infinite Number of others were killed upon the ſame days, who had favoured the ſide of <hi>Geta.</hi> The Servants that had waited upon him. In all
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52508:160"/> places, and in the very Baths, were there Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres committed upon ſome as they were at their Suppers; amongſt whom was <hi>Sammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Severus,</hi> who is known by his many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Books. <hi>Chilo</hi> who was twice Captain of the Guards and Conſul, was in the greateſt danger, for only having adviſed the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to an agreement with one another. For the Soldiers had ſtript him, and were hurrying him away to the Execution when further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders came to ſpare him. He put to death <hi>Helvius Pertinax,</hi> for no other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the Son of an Emperor. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſed to kill, upon ſome occaſion or other, thoſe who had been his Brother's Friends. He frequently and proudly inveighed both againſt the Senate and the People, not forbearing to value himſelf one day, becauſe he was another <hi>Sylla.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then he went into <hi>Gallia,</hi> whither he was no ſooner come, than he put to death the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul of the <hi>Narbonnoiſe.</hi> He made ſuch a havock, and ſuch a confuſion amongſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of this Province, that he was as much hated, as the moſt outragious Tyrant ever was. Sometimes nevertheleſs he would diſguiſe his ſanguinary and cruel Nature, and pretend to be gracious. He did a great many things here againſt the Rights of the Country, and the People. And then he was taken with a great ſickneſs, and yet he was afterwards very Cruel to thoſe; who even recovered him. Next<note place="margin">

But having received a Victory over the <hi>Germans,</hi> he called himſelf <hi>Germanicus,</hi> without any regard to the nearneſs of that Name to <hi>Germanus,</hi> that is, his own Brother whom he had killed. And had he, he ſaid, overcome the <hi>Lucani,</hi> he would have been called <hi>Lucanicus,</hi> although it is a word which in another Senſe, ſignifies an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Diſhonour. He put to death ſuch as had but made Water in the place, where ſtand the Statues or the Images of the Emperor; or had taken off the Crowns from the Heads of any Images to place them elſewhere, or uſed Amulets about their Necks, for Charms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Quartan</hi> and <hi>Tertian</hi> Agues. He took his way by <hi>Throce,</hi> in company with the Captain of the Guards; and thence croſſing the Sea into <hi>Aſia,</hi> his Sail-yard broke, and he was in danger to be wreckt, had he not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the Pinnace, and ſo was taken into a ſtout Veſſel, where the Admiral was that convoy'd him. He often with his Sword in<note place="margin">His Strength.</note> hand, hath ſtood a Combate with Wild-Boars. Once he fought a Lyon, of which he gloried much in his Letters, which he ſent to his Friends, and boaſted, that he was arrived to the Power of <hi>Hercules.</hi>

                     <p>Coming into <hi>Aſia,</hi> he applied himſelf to the matter of the War with the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> in which he appointed a General to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, who was of the ſame Kidney with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

But when this was done, he put them all to the Sword, after the Example of <hi>Ptolemy Euergetes,</hi> the Eighth of that Name, King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who had practiſed the like Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity. At the ſame time, upon a ſignal given to his Soldiers, they fell every one upon his own Hoſt and murdered him, and committed a vaſt ſlaughter throughout the City of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi> Afterwards he marched againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> by the Borders of the People called <hi>Caduſii,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and coming to a tumultuary Engagement with them, he let looſe amongſt them Wild Beaſts; after which he ſent his Diſpatches about it to the Senate, to the end, to obtain the Title of Conqueror of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> as if he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten never ſo great a Victory. He was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelf for another Campaign, when going from the City of <hi>Rhea</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where he wintered, to <hi>Heren</hi> or <hi>Charan,</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at the Worſhip of the Moon, and by the way, alighting from his Horſe to make Water, he was ſtabbed the ſame moment upon the Eighth of the Ides of <hi>April,</hi> being his Birth-Day, and the Feſtival of <hi>Cybele,</hi> by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:52508:161"/> which was laid for the purpoſe by <hi>Macrinus</hi> the Captain of the Guards, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Empire after him. Thoſe who were privy to the ſame beſides, were <hi>Nemeſianus,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> and <hi>Rhaetianus</hi> who commanded the ſecond Legion; nor was the deſign unknown to <hi>Martius Agrippa</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, nor to a great many other principal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who had been brought into it by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation, eſpecially, of one <hi>Martial</hi> a Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion.</p>
                     <p>He was killed in the midway, betwixt the Cities of <hi>Rhea</hi> and <hi>Heren,</hi> where he had an occaſion to alight, as I ſaid, from his Horſe. The Guards were of the number of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators; and ſo as the Quirry lifted him up to his Horſe again, he ſtruck him into the Body with a Dagger.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the Death of <hi>Papinian,</hi> I<note place="margin">Papinian'<hi>s Death.</hi>
                        </note> know very well, that it is variouſly repreſented by a great many, as if they did not know the real cauſe it. However, I think fit to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh what to me ſeems to be the Truth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than I will be ſilent upon the Murder of ſo great a Perſon. <hi>Papinian,</hi> it is ſaid, was one in very great Favour with the Emperor <hi>Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius Severus,</hi> to whom, ſome add, that he was ſomewhat akin by his ſecond Wife. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Severus</hi> had recommended unto him the Care of his two Sons, whom accordingly he exhorted to a good Agreement with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo interpoſed againſt the Murder of <hi>Geta.</hi> But for this, he, together with the reſt who were Favourers of <hi>Geta,</hi> was killed by the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:52508:162"/> expreſs Order of <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> who, as ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add, had deſired <hi>Papinian</hi> to extenuate for him, to the Senate and the People the death of <hi>Geta.</hi> But <hi>Papinian</hi> anſwered, <hi>That it was not ſo eaſie to excuſe a Murder, as it was to commit it.</hi> They ſay alſo that <hi>Papinian</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to dictate the Speech, in which <hi>Baſſianus</hi> was to inveigh againſt his Brother, to the end, to render his own Cauſe the better in killing him; and that <hi>Papinian</hi> ſaid, that, to accuſe the Innocent, who had been murdered, was in the nature of another Murder. But all this however, does not very well agree. Becauſe it was not for the Captain of the Guards to form the Emperor's Speeches; and then it is certain that <hi>Papinian</hi> was for no other reaſon killed, but as he was a Fautor of <hi>Geta.</hi> As the Soldiers were hurrying him away to his Execution, he ſaid, <hi>That he ſhould be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, who was the Captain of the Guards after him, if he did not ſeverely revenge the Cruelty that was ſhewn to his place.</hi> Which was afterwards done. For <hi>Macrinus</hi> his Succeſſor, was the Author of the Death of <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> and was afterwards himſelf made Emperor in the Camp; whoſe Son <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new named <hi>Antoninus Diadumenus,</hi> to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Soldiers, becauſe the name of an <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> was ſo dear to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Baſſianus Antoninus Caracallus</hi> lived Forty Three Years, and reigned Six. He was No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly buried, and left a Son, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Varius Antoninus Heliogabalus;</hi> the dear Name of <hi>Antoninus</hi> being ſo fixt in the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:52508:162"/> Hearts of Men, that it was no more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, than that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> from the Perſon of the Emperor. He was a Prince of ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and crueller than his too cruel Father. He eat and drank freely, but was hated by his Servants, and by all the Men of the Sword, only the Guards. The Works which he left<note place="margin">His pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Works.</note> behind him at <hi>Rome</hi> were, the famous Baths of his own Name, in which there is one Room ſo Curious, that the Architects ſay, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inimitable. He left alſo a Portico of the Name of his Father, repreſenting the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Actions of his Father's Life, with his Wars and Triumphs. He received the Name of <hi>Caracallus</hi> from a Garment ſo called, which he firſt brought up and gave to the People of <hi>Rome</hi> for a Bounty. He repaired the <hi>Via Nova,</hi> which is below his Baths, ſo well, that you will ſcarce find a Street in <hi>Rome,</hi> that is fairer than it. He erected ſtately Temples in all places to the Honour of the Goddeſs <hi>Iſis,</hi> whoſe Sacrifices he celebrated with much greater Reverence than ever had been uſed before at <hi>Rome.</hi> His Body was interred in the Sepulchre of the <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s, that the ſame place ſhould receive his Reliques, which had given him that Name.</p>
                     <p>It is now fit that I ſhould relate how it is ſaid that he came to marry his Mother-in-Law, <hi>Julia;</hi> ſhe was very handſome, and as ſhe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd one day in negligence, to diſcover her Body a little naked; <hi>Ah, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52508:163"/> to give Laws to all the World, and not take them from any.</hi> He no ſooner had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſenſe of thoſe Words, but his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Paſſion led him to reſolve upon the accompliſhment of the Crime, and ſo he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated thoſe Nuptials with her, which<note place="margin">His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Marriage.</note> were in effect the ſame, as to take to Wife his own Mother, and to add Inceſt with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the Murder of his Brother. It will not be improper here to remark a very picquant thing, which was ſaid of him. As he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to himſelf the Titles in his ſtile of <hi>Germanicus, Parthicus, Arabicus,</hi> and <hi>Aleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> becauſe of his Conqueſts over the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and thoſe other Nations; <hi>Helvius Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax,</hi> the Son of the Emperor <hi>Pertinax,</hi> ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſaid, <hi>His Majeſty might be pleaſed to add</hi> Geticus Maximus: In which word <hi>Geticus,</hi> there is an equivocation, with a double relation to <hi>Geta</hi> his Brother, whom he had killed; and with relation to the <hi>Goths,</hi> called <hi>Getae,</hi> whom he had overcome in ſome running Fights, in his paſſage into the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Death of <hi>Geta</hi> was prognoſticated by ſeveral Prodigies, as we ſhall ſhew by and by in his own Life, which follows. In the mean time we ſhall only obſerve farther, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, when the Army had propoſed <hi>Baſſianus Antoninus</hi> to march at the Head of them, in the place of <hi>Severus</hi> his Father, who was ſo ſick of the Gout, that he could not well follow the War; <hi>Severus</hi> was then for putting to death th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> his Son <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> if the Captains of the Guards had not over-perſuaded him againſt it. On
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:52508:163"/> the contrary, others ſay, that the Captains of the Guards were for puniſhing <hi>Baſſianus</hi> with Death, but that his Father was againſt it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not willing, that the fooliſh Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a young Man ſhould be reſented ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, as for his own Father to kill him, when the Soldiers rather were the great occaſions of the Crime. However it is, this moſt cruel Prince <hi>Baſſianus Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> who in a word was a Parricide, Inceſtuous, an Enemy of his Father, Mother, and Brother, was yet by <hi>Macrinus</hi> that killed him, out of fear of the Soldiers, and eſpecially thoſe of the Guards, after his Death made a God. A Temple was given him, and an Order of Prieſts appointed to ſerve him. Even the Temple of <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> built by <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> at the Foot of the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> was re-dedicated to him; and his Son <hi>Antoninus Heliogabalus,</hi> tranſlated the ſame again afterwards, to either <hi>Jupiter Syrius,</hi> or the Sun, or himſelf, but to which of the Three, I cannot very well aſſert.</p>

                     <p>His other name of <hi>Geta</hi> was what he had from either his Father's Brother, or from his Grandfather, whoſe names were <hi>Geta.</hi> There were yet other reaſons for the addition of that name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> to this of <hi>Geta. Severus</hi> would have had it to be a Rule, that all Princes in the time to come ſhould be Entitled <hi>Antonini,</hi>
                        <pb n="320" facs="tcp:52508:166"/> in the ſame manner as they are <hi>Auguſti.</hi> Which was the effect of his great love to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> whoſe Son he was pleaſed to call himſelf, and whoſe Wiſdom and the Precepts of his Philoſophy he always endeavoured to imitate. And not only the effect of his love to that Prince, who was an <hi>Antoninus</hi> but by Adoption, but of his Love and Honour alſo to <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of <hi>Hadrian;</hi> by reaſon, that it was <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> who had preferred him from a Practicer in the Law to be the <hi>Keeper of the Exchequer;</hi> which was a happy Riſe to him, and which had opened him the way to thoſe great Advantages, that afterwards he came to attain unto: who thought therefore, that he could not borrow a name from any Prince better, than from one whoſe Reign had been ſo happy; nor a name more honourable than that, that had already run through four Emperors. Being skilful in the Doctrine of Aſtrology, as many of the <hi>Africans</hi> generally are, he ſaid one day, becauſe he knew the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of <hi>Geta; I admire, dear</hi> Juvenalis, (who was the Captain of the Guards to him) <hi>to think, that my</hi> Geta <hi>ſhall be a God, in whoſe Nativity I ſee nothing to make him an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</hi> Nor did his skill at all deceive him; for after <hi>Geta</hi> had been killed by his Brother, and his Brother apprehended that he had drawn upon himſelf the hatred of a Tyrant by the Crime, he underſtanding that it would be ſweetned if he did but declare <hi>Geta</hi> a God, cried, <hi>Sit Divus dum not ſit Vivus; Let him be
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52508:166"/> a God, ſo he is not an Emperor;</hi> and ſo he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated him; by which the Murderer in ſome meaſure retrieved to himſelf the good Grace of the People again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Geta Antoninus,</hi> was born at the City of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> under the Conſulſhips of <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius,</hi> upon the ſixth of the Calends of <hi>June.</hi> His Mother was <hi>Julia;</hi> who was <hi>Severus</hi>'s ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wife, being her whom he had choſen to Marry, becauſe he had heard, that ſhe had it<note place="margin">Good and bad O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens.</note> in her Nativity to be the Wife of a King; though himſelf was at that time a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, only in a good Employment in the State. As ſoon as he was born, it was told by one that a Hen had laid an Egg in the Houſe, which was of a <hi>Purple</hi> colour. So the Egg was brought up; but <hi>Baſſianus</hi> taking it in his hands and letting it fall, like a Child, to the Ground, that it brake, <hi>Julia</hi> ſaid to him laughing, <hi>You wicked Villain, you have killed your Brother. Severus</hi> took more notice of this Expreſſion at that time, than any other Body: but afterwards all the Company lookt upon it as a thing ſpoken, as it were, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. Another Omen that happened was this: upon the ſame day, and in the ſame hour that <hi>Geta</hi> was born, a Plebeian of the name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> had at his Farm in the Country a Lamb kidded, with a mark upon his Head of the colour of <hi>Purple:</hi> and being informed by a Soothſayer, that an <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Empire after <hi>Severus,</hi> he very fondly interpreted it of himſelf; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever killed the Lamb (in which conſiſted the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52508:167"/> ſign of the death of <hi>Geta</hi>) for fear that the Omen of ſo high a Fortune ſhould bring him into danger. I would add one thing more, which the Event made People to interpret to the ſame purpoſe; which is, that when <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> one day Celebrated the Birth of <hi>Geta,</hi> his Brother <hi>Baſſianus</hi> killed the Sacrifice himſelf, in the place of the Prieſt. A Circumſtance not then conſidered nor taken notice of; but it was afterwards very well underſtood, when that Brother had ſacrificed his Brother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Geta,</hi> was in his temper a rough ſort of a<note place="margin">His Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Youth; though not to a Fault; handſome, a little eager, a lover of delicious Wines and good Chear. There is this Story of him, which is remarkable, when he was a Boy. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> being for Eradicating wholly the Parties that oppoſed him, ſaid once to his Sons, I do but rid you of your Enemies. So <hi>Baſſianus</hi> adviſed him to cut them off all Root and Branch; them and their Children: but <hi>Geta</hi> askt the queſtion, how many of them they were? His Father telling him, ſays he again, <hi>Have they Parents and Relations living?</hi> Yes. <hi>Then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there will be more People in</hi> Rome <hi>ſorry for your Victory, than there will be that are glad of it.</hi> And certainly <hi>Geta</hi>'s Opinion had carried it, had not <hi>Plautianus</hi> the Captain of Guards, and <hi>Juvenal</hi> who had great intereſts, inſiſted upon the contrary, in hopes of enriching themſelves by the Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Eſtates: which was again ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the exceſſive Cruelty of <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> who perſiſting in his firſt Opinion, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52508:167"/> 
                        <hi>He would have them all cut off; them and their Children;</hi> ſays <hi>Geta</hi> to him; <hi>You; who ſpare no Body, would kill your own Brother.</hi> Which, as then ſpoken, ſignified nothing: but afterwards it appeared to be a ſort of a Propheſie.</p>
                     <p>He had an excellent Memory to improve himſelf by what he read in the Antients, and by what his Father taught him. His Brother had always hated him; but he was more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by his Mother <hi>Julia,</hi> than ever <hi>Baſſianus</hi> was by his. He ſpoke agreeably, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Stammering: he was curious in his Dreſs, to exceſs: and whatever was preſented him, he applied it to his own Ornament, without giving it away to any body living. After the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, at what time his Father flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in great glory, as <hi>Baſſianus</hi> was declared a Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Empire with his Father, ſo <hi>Geta</hi> was Created a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and honoured with the name of <hi>Antoninus Geta.</hi> It was an uſual diverſion with him to propoſe to the Grammarians, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about the ſeveral Cries and Voices of Animals, <hi>As the Sheep Bleats, the Swine Grunts, the Dove Coos, the Lion Roars, the Elephant Brays, the Frog Croaks, the Horſe Whinnies, the Aſs Brays, the Ox Lows;</hi> and to prove the uſe of the proper Latin Terms for each, out of the Antients. He read much in the Books of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus Sammonicus,</hi> written to <hi>Antoninus.</hi> As to the Table, he took a pleaſure to obſerve an <hi>Alphabet;</hi> according to which, as every Letter came on each day in its Courſe, his Servants that knew it, and were well skilled in the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52508:168"/> Arts of eating, provided things of the names, beginning with that Letter. As for example, for the Letter <hi>P. Puddings Plover, Pullet, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, Peacock, Pig, Piſcis, Plumbs,</hi> and ſo upon other days for the other Letters in order. Which is an Argument that from his Youth he had a gay choice of things, and was a very pleaſant Perſon.</p>
                     <p>After he was killed by his Brother, a Party of the Soldiers who had not been Corrupted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his Murder very ill; ſaying all of them, <hi>That they had promiſed Fidelity to the two Sons of</hi> Severus, <hi>and ought to keep it equally to them both.</hi> Accordingly they kept faſt the Paſſes of their Camp; and refuſed to give entrance to <hi>Baſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> till he had flattered them up, and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed their Heats by giving them a Bounty, which was vaſtly great. After this <hi>Papinian,</hi> and many others were Maſſacred, who had either encouraged the good agreement of the two Brothers, or had appeared to be of the Side of <hi>Geta.</hi> Perſons of Quality of both the Senatorian and the Equeſtrian Orders were Butchered, up and down publickly in the Baths and other places. <hi>Papinian</hi> died by the Axe; <hi>Baſſianus</hi> finding fault with the Executioner that he had not done it with a Sword. In the mean time he was ſo afraid of his own Perſon, that he wore a Coat of Mail under his Purple, when he went to the Senate, to give them an account of what he did, and of the death of <hi>Geta.</hi> At which time, as <hi>Fauſtinus</hi> the Praetor repeated the Imperial Style, ſaying, <hi>Sarmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Parthicus Maximus,</hi> Titles
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52508:168"/> which <hi>Baſſianus</hi> had gained by his Victories over the <hi>Sarmatae</hi> and the <hi>Parthians, Helvius Pertinax,</hi> the Son of the Emperor of that name, ſuggeſted it to him to ſay, and add to the reſt <hi>Geticus Maximus;</hi> as if he meant it, in relation to his Victories over the <hi>Goths,</hi> who were then called <hi>Getae;</hi> but there was an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in the Word; for it alſo referred to the Murder of his Brother <hi>Geta.</hi> This ſunk deep into the Breaſt of <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> as it appeared afterwards by his putting to death the Author, and not him only, but thoſe others, as I have ſaid above. More particularly, as to <hi>Helvius Pertinax,</hi> he was willing to cut him off, upon the account that he was in the good eſteem of all the World; and then beſides he was the Son of an Emperor, which it ſelf was no very ſafe Circumſtance for a private Perſon.</p>
                     <p>The Funeral of <hi>Antoninus Geta</hi> was ſo very<note place="margin">His ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> Fine, that one would not have thought the ſame Brother that buried him, had killed him. He was buried in the Sepulchre of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, that is to ſay, of <hi>Severus</hi> his Father, which is upon the <hi>Appian</hi> way. In fine it is to be obſerved, that the Careſſes of <hi>Antoninus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racallus Baſſianus,</hi> were more to be dreaded than his Frowns. He had an unaccountable Quality with him, to ſpeak the faireſt and the kindlieſt to thoſe in appearance, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to deſtroy. And again, it was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to all to ſee him lament, as he did, the death of <hi>Geta,</hi> as often as his name was menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, or his Picture, or his Statue came in ſight. He was therefore a Man of many
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52508:169"/> Windings and Turnings in his Humour; and this being accompanied with as much Cruelty as if he thirſted after Blood, it made him, that he would one time Maſſacre the Friends, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time the Enemies of <hi>Geta,</hi> as Fortune of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to him; ſo that the loſs of <hi>Geta,</hi> by the ſame means, became lamented more and more.</p>

                     <p>WHen Princes, either have not ſat very long upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Throne, or have not been Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of any extraordinary Characters before their Acceſſion to it, ſo that there is but little to be ſaid of their Reigns, for the ſhortneſs of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:52508:170"/> them, and leſs perhaps of their private Lives, in which they might never have been known, if they had not aſpired to the Empire; It is not to be admired if their Memories ſhould ſometimes lye buried in obſcurity. Therefore for my part, what I can find, that I do think may be deſerving to be committed to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and worthy to be reſeued out of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of divers Hiſtorians, I ſhall produce it to the World; apprehending this to be the Duty of him, who propoſes to write the Lives of others; that is, not to recount every thing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t a Man does, but with Judgment to make a Choice of what is more particularly deſerving of Memory. So that I ſhould think, that <hi>Aelius Junius Cordus,</hi> who hath taken the Pains to publiſh the Lives of thoſe Emperors, whom he believes to be more obſcure and leſs known than others, hath not yet acquitted himſelf of his Deſign with the greateſt Succeſs. Becauſe as ſhort as he is, he hath yet reported things that are ſcarce worth the Labour of the Writing them. He ſuffers not the leaſt trifles to eſcape him, as if concerning <hi>Trajan, Antoninus Pius,</hi> or <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> it ſignifieth any thing to know every time that they went abroad, or how they changed their Habits, and who every Perſon was that they preferred, and when; or when they were ſerved with other Via<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52508:170"/> made of them; unleſs it is, when it is proper to give a Judgment by them of certain Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which may be really worth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and even then, it is fit to touch them only in part and to leave the reſt to be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Reader.</p>
                     <p>After the Death of the Emperor <hi>Baſſianus Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> his Captain of the Guards, <hi>Opilius Macrinus,</hi> who had before that been the keeper of his Privy-Purſe, poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Empire. A Man of a low Birth,<note place="margin">His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> not a Gentleman born or bred; full of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance both in his Humour and his Looks; ſometimes he called himſelf by the Name of <hi>Severus,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Antoninus;</hi> but yet every body hated him, as well the Soldiers, as the People. He ingaged himſelf immediately in the War with the <hi>Parthians,</hi> to take away by that means from the Soldiers the leiſure to make Reflections upon him, and ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Power, or at leaſt to ſtop the ill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from growing, as much as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, under which he lay. The Senate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed willingly accepted him to be Emperor; but yet it was chiefly, out of their hatred to the memory of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> in relation to whom they oried out with one Voice, <hi>Any body rather than a Parricide; any Perſon rather than an inceſtuous, and an impure Homicide; any one, rather than a Murderer of the Senate and the People.</hi> It may be perhaps a Matter of ſome admiration, why <hi>Macrinus,</hi> having been the Author of the Death of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, who was by Name an <hi>Antoninus,</hi> ſhould
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52508:171"/> nevertheleſs order his Son <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> to be called <hi>Antoninus Diadumenus.</hi> Now that which I find upon the Annals, as to that matter, is this.</p>
                     <p>The Oracle of the Goddeſs <hi>Coeleſtis</hi> in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> having been conſulted by the Proconſul, about the State of the Empire, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, in the time of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> about the Emperors. After other things, ſhe particularly repeated the Name of <hi>Antoninus</hi> eight times; whereby it was underſtood, that the Emperor <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> ſhould Reign eight Years. But when that Prince had out-lived that term, ſo that if any Faith was to be given to the Oracle, ſomething elſe than that was deſigned by it, which time was to produce. It was ſuppoſed at laſt to ſignifie, that the number of the Emperors of the Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> ſhould be eight; and ſo they are. To wit, <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> the Firſt; <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> the Second; <hi>Verus Antoninus</hi> his Colleague in the Empire, the Third; <hi>Commodus Antoninus,</hi> the Fourth; <hi>Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> the Fifth; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus Geta,</hi> the Sixth; <hi>Antoninus Diadume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the Seventh; and <hi>Antoninus Heliogabalus,</hi> the Eighth. For as for the Two <hi>Gordiani,</hi> or <hi>Severus,</hi> or <hi>Pertinax,</hi> or <hi>Julianus,</hi> or <hi>Opilius Macrinus,</hi> who did all of them ſometimes call themſelves <hi>Antonini,</hi> they are never to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of the number of the true <hi>Antonini,</hi> but only thoſe Eight now mentioned, by whom that Name was more retained, than any of their own. Now <hi>Macrinus</hi> was willing to give his Son the Name of an <hi>Antoninus,</hi> for
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:52508:171"/> this reaſon, becauſe the People ſhould have the leſs occaſion to ſuſpect, that the late Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of that Name had been kill'd by his Orders; and becauſe he knew very well, that every one had ſuch an extraordinary Love for that Name, that unleſs the Emperor was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Antoninus,</hi> they could ſcarce think him an Emperor.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Opilius Macrinus</hi> was alſo kill'd, and the Senate was aſſured that <hi>Varius Heliogabalus</hi> the Son of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> was declared Emperor by the Army; then it was, that it was loudly repreſented in the Senate, what an ignoble Perſon <hi>Macrinus</hi> was. <hi>Aurelius Victor Pinnius</hi> ſpoke thus.</p>
                     <p>Macrinus, <hi>a Slave the other day, that drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His mean Original.</note> 
                        <hi>in the ſervile Offices of the Emperor's Family! a Bougre! a Hireling! He lived a paltry Life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>der</hi> Commodus. Severus <hi>thought him not fit at firſt for the moſt miſerable Employments, but turned him out, and baniſhed him into</hi> Africa; <hi>where to cover his Infamy, he betook himſelf to Letters, and came to plead ſome ſmall Cauſes, and to declaim, and at laſt to be a Juſtice. Then he was created a Gentleman, and ſo at length, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to be the Keeper of the Exchequer under</hi> Severus, <hi>by the Favour of</hi> Feſtus, <hi>who was an infranchiſed Slave of that Prince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This relation however, is not ſo undoubted, but that others give us the Steps of his Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus. That he was a Gladiator, and had ſought in that quality publickly. Obtaining afterwards his Freedom, he went into <hi>Africa,</hi> where he was a Notary, and raiſing himſelf
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:52508:172"/> after that, to be the Keeper of the Emperor's Exchequer, from thence he ſucceeded unto the higheſt Honors. Whilſt he was the Captain of the Guards, he contrived the Death of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, with that dexterity of Intrigue, that it could not be perceived, that he had the leaſt hand it it. He gained upon a Quirry to give the Blow; what with the Money he bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him with, and what with the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that he made him. And then it was ſo ordered, that it ſhould be ſaid, that he was killed in a Mutiny of the Soldiers; becauſe for his murdering his Brother, and the Inceſt of his marrying his Mother, he was ſo odious to them.</p>
                     <p>But no ſooner was this done, but <hi>Macrinus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Make his Son</hi> Caeſar.</note> poſſeſſed himſelf of his place, and made his Son <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> whom he immediately called by the Name of <hi>Antoninus Diadumenus,</hi> his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with him in the ſame. Then he ſent the Body of the deceaſed to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be interred in the Sepulchre of his Anceſtors; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Captain of the Guards, who was his own late Colleague in that Office, to take care of burying him in all reſpects honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; knowing that the Common People loved him for the Habits and the Largeſſes that he had given amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>As he was afraid of a popular Emotion, and that ſome body ſhould intervene and hinder his Reign, ſo he was glad to take the Empire, as it were by ſurpriſe; but yet in the mean time he ſerved himſelf of that common Artifice to pretend, that it was againſt his Inclination.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:52508:172"/> Particularly he was jealous of the Captain of the Guards, his late Colleague, becauſe ſome People hoped, that if he had the Conſent but of one Legion, he would not refuſe an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, in which they would be ready to ſerve him, out of the hatred they had to <hi>Opilius Macrinus</hi> for his ill Life, and for the ignoble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Education and Birth. He took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, as I ſaid, the Name of <hi>Severus,</hi> though he had no relation to that Prince; which occaſioned a good raillery upon both him and his Son; <hi>Macrinus</hi> is a <hi>Severus,</hi> as <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumenus</hi> is an <hi>Antoninus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to put a ſtop to any Commotion of the Soldiers, he immediately gave a Bounty, as well to the Legions, as the Guards, which was more than ordinarily large; and as it is the Cuſtom ſo to do, his Money ſupplied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his Innocence; and what he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one, he made up with the other; by virtue whereof, he continued in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire for ſome time, although he was a Man of all manner of Vice. He writ Letters to the Senate, concerning the Murder of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> in which he ſtiled him a God; proteſting as to himſelf, that he was innocent, and had known nothing of it; and ſo he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Crime that he had committed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>
                        <hi>We ſhould have been heartily glad, Fathers of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> 
                        <hi>the Senate, to have had our Sovereign</hi> Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>yet in ſafety, and returning to you in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. We ſhould all have been happy in ſuch a flouriſhing State of the Empire, and under a Prince, who was a Succeſſour of the</hi> Antonini, <hi>and given us from the Gods. But ſince this Happineſs hath not befaln us, by reaſon of a Mutiny of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which hath deprived us of it, we make you acquainted with what the Army hath done as to us in the firſt place; and next we with your Conſents, decree an</hi> Apotheoſis <hi>to be given imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to our late Prince, whoſe Murder the Army hath thought no Man more worthy to avenge than his own Captain of the Guards, to whom himſelf had left it, to chaſtiſe the Faction, had he eſcaped their hands and lived.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In another place, ſays he, <hi>They have preſented me with the Empire, which I have therefore taken into my Protection; and I ſhall continue it, if the ſame thing be pleaſing to you, Fathers of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, which is ſo pleaſing to them, to whom I have given a Bounty, and done every thing as the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is for the Emperors to do upon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>My Son</hi> Diadumenus, <hi>whom you know, the Army hath made my Partner in the Empire, and hath not denied him the Name of</hi> Antoninus. <hi>Indeed, they have done him a greater Honour by that Name, than by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Prince; which we deſire may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:52508:173"/> by you, Fathers of the Senate, as a good and happy Omen, that you ſhall never want a Prince of a Name which you do ſo dearly love.</hi> Again, <hi>We and all the Army have equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the Honours of a God unto</hi> Antoninus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racallus. <hi>And though we might with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Emperors command the ſame from you, Fathers of the Senate; yet we rather deſire you to do it, and to dedicate to him, two Statues on Horſeback, two more ſtanding in Military Habit, and two others ſitting in a Civil one. We dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate alſo two triumphal Statues to the Emperor</hi> Severus. <hi>All which, Fathers of the Senate, you will command to be performed, at our earneſt Requeſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When this was read in the Senate, they took the news of the death of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus</hi> very well, and hoping that <hi>Opilius Macrinus</hi> would maintain the publick Liberty, they firſt made him a <hi>Patrician,</hi> who was a Man originally of no Family, and little known; then they made him High-Prieſt, (a Title annexed to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors) who ſometime before, had been a Clerk to the <hi>minor</hi> Prieſts: And laſtly, they voted him the Title of <hi>Pious.</hi> Nevertheleſs, at the firſt, upon the News of the Death of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callus,</hi> there was a long ſilence in the Senate, becauſe no body dared to be forward to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. But it was no ſooner confirmed to them, that he was really killed, but they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt him as a Tyrant; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they conferred the Proconſular and the Tribunitian Powers upon <hi>Macrinus,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from them the Title of the <hi>Happy,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52508:174"/> of that of the <hi>Pious,</hi> and was pleaſed that the Name of <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſhould be confirmed by them to his Son.</p>
                     <p>And here I may obſerve, that this Name which began in a Prince, who was in reality, as well as by Title <hi>Pious,</hi> came by degrees, through a number of others one after another, who impaired its Reputation more and more, to end at laſt in a Man ſo impious, that he was the very ſcum of the Earth. <hi>Marcus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> was the only Prince after <hi>Pius,</hi> who adorned it by a Life worthy of it: <hi>Verus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> his Partner, degenerated from it, and <hi>Commodus Antoninus</hi> even polluted it. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus?</hi> Or what of <hi>Antoninus Diadumenus?</hi> What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Antoninus Heliogabalus?</hi> But as he was the laſt of the <hi>Antoninuſſes,</hi> and baſe born, ſo he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to have lived in the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity.</p>
                     <p>

He engaged the Enemy, as they were commanded by <hi>Artabanus</hi> their King, who fought obſtinately. But after this, a Peace being agreed upon, then <hi>Macrinus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to Luxury, his Legions took a juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from thence to revolt from him to <hi>Varius Heliogabalus,</hi> who was the reputed Son of <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Baſſianus Caracallus;</hi> and who coming with

                     <p>There was a Lady called <hi>Moeſa,</hi> alias <hi>Varia,</hi> a <hi>Phoenician,</hi> of the City of <hi>Emiſſa,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Julia,</hi> the Wife of the Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> who after the Death of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> was baniſhed the Court by <hi>Macrinus;</hi> but yet ſhe was allowed to take along with her, all the effects which ſhe had amaſſed in the long time of her continuance there. This Lady had two Daughters, called <hi>Semiamira</hi> and <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maea:</hi> The firſt and eldeſt was the Mother of <hi>Varius Heliogabalus,</hi> who was a Prieſt of the Sun, and had taken the Name of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Language, from the Name of the God that he worſhipped. And being as well by his noble Stature and his Beauty, as by his Office remarkable to all that came to the Temple, eſpecially the Soldiers, his Grand-Mother <hi>Moeſa,</hi> alias <hi>Varia,</hi> took her opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſay to them, that he was the Son of the Emperor <hi>Antoninus Baſſianus Caracallus,</hi> which from one to another, came to be made known to all. And as ſhe was herſelf very rich, and <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> very prodigal, ſhe made ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to them in his behalf, that ſhe ſeduced the Legions to a revolt; who accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him and his Mother, and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into a Garriſon by Night, and proclaimed him Emperor, by the Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and inveſted him with the marks of that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:52508:175"/>
                     <p>When this Account was brought unto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> he admiring at the boldneſs of the Woman, which he could not but ſlight at the ſame time, ſent <hi>Julianus</hi> the Captain of his Guards with his Legions to beſiege her. But no ſooner did the New <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſhew himſelf in Perſon to thoſe Men, but they were all ſo marvellouſly inclined to love him, that they killed <hi>Julianus</hi> their Captain, and paſſed over in a Body to his ſide. Then <hi>Antoninus Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus</hi> having formed his Army ſet himſelf to march againſt <hi>Macrinus,</hi> as <hi>Macrinus</hi> was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him; and joyning Battel, <hi>Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was defeated; occaſioned by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of his own Soldiers, by reaſon of their Love to <hi>Antoninus.</hi> So he fled with ſome few in company with him, and particularly his Son. But both he and his Son were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards purſued and killed in a Village of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia,</hi> and his Head cut off and brought to the Conqueror. And all that his Son had gotten by the Empire, was his Deſtiny only to be killed with his Father.</p>
                     <p>Certainly <hi>Macrinus</hi> was in the time that he reigned more rigorous, and more auſtere than he had ever been before, thereby hoping to ſuppreſs the Reports of all his by-paſt Actions, and to bury them in oblivion; on the contrary, that Severity did but open a freſh occaſion to People to blame him. Thus he was for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf to be called a <hi>Severus</hi> and a <hi>Pertinax:</hi> And when the Senate had given him the Titles of the <hi>Happy,</hi> and the <hi>Pious,</hi> he
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52508:175"/> only accepted the firſt, and refuſed the other, which occaſioned a Libel to be made upon him, which was put up in the <hi>Forum</hi> in Greek and Latin Verſe to this purpoſe; <hi>That an old, ugly, troubleſome, ſour, and unreaſonable Man of a Stage-player</hi> (alluding to his fighting, formerly, as a Gladiator) <hi>pretending to be Happy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being at the ſame time Pious, it was a thing unnatural and irrational, for thoſe were two Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues not to be ſeparated. An impious Reign will make his Subjects unhappy, and he who makes his Subjects ſo, muſt be unhappy himſelf.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Macrinus</hi> was therefore one of a proud and bloody Mind; he loved to govern with the arbitrarineſs of a Soldier; accuſed the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of former times, and praiſed <hi>Severus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, of all the Emperors. He condemned his Soldiers to the Croſs, and always puniſhed them with the puniſhments of Slaves. In any Mutiny he generally decimated; ſometimes he contented himſelf to centeſimate them; which laſt was a peculiar word of his own, when he drew out but every hundredth Man when to execute, which he accounted a Mercy, he had ſaid, they deſerved to be decimated, or viceſimated. Certainly, it would be too tedious here to recount all his Cruelties. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, one I will mention, which was not great as he thought it; and yet it is ſomething worſe than the Barbarities of all the Tyrants that ever were. Two Soldiers were reported to have forced their Landlord's Maid againſt her Will, to lye with them, at the ſame time ſhe
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52508:176"/> was one that had been debauched long before He hearing of it by his Spies, ſent for them and examined the Matter; and it appearing to be true, he ordered Two vaſt great Oxe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to be opened alive ſuddenly, and the Men to be ſtuffed into their Bellies, there to remain till they died, with only their Heads out, that they could talk to one another; which was a ſort of a Puniſhment that had nothing like it then, or in any former times, in the caſe of Adultery itſelf. In his Wars, always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, againſt the <hi>Parthians, Armenians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> he quitted himſelf with equal bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſucceſs. A Tribune one day having neglected to appoint the Guard, he dragged<note place="margin">His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.</note> him alive and dead in a miſerable Condition at a Cart's Tail, all his march. He revived the Puniſhment of <hi>Mezentius,</hi> of tying the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the dead, for both to rot together: Therefore it was ſaid by the People in the Cirque, in favour of his Son <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> who was a very lovely Youth,</p>
                     <q>—<hi>dignus, cui pater haud Mezentius eſſet.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <q>
                        <hi>It was pity he had a</hi> Mezentius <hi>for his Father.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>He ſhut up others betwixt four Walls, till they died ſtarving. For Adultery he always tied the Parties body to body, and burnt them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether alive. Servants that had run from their Maſters, he condemned to be made Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of. Unleſs Informers proved what they ſaid, he made it Capital to them; if they did
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52508:176"/> it, they received a Reward in Money, but he diſmiſſed them with all their Infamy upon them.</p>
                     <p>He was not a little verſed in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> inſomuch, that he made no ſcruple to ſuperſede all the Reſcripts of the antient Emperors, to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Right, and not according to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts. And it was a ſhame, he ſaid, that the Wills of ſuch as <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Caracallus,</hi> and others that were unworthy to be Emperors, ſhould be Laws; when <hi>Trajan</hi> would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that a Reſcript that is written perhaps in favour in one caſe ſhould be made a precedent in another; becauſe things ought to be examined by the Rules of good Senſe. He was liberal in his allowances of Bread and Proviſions to the Poor, but ſparing in giving Money. Towards his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants he was ſo ſevere, and ſo cruel, that they called him inſtead of <hi>Macrinus, Macellinus,</hi> from <hi>Macellum</hi> a Shambles; becauſe his Houſe, like a Shambles, flowed with the Blood of the Servants that he killed. He eat and drank very freely, ſometimes to exceſs in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. If he had dined at any time more ſparingly, in his ſupper he would be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe. He admitted the Men of Letters to his Table, with whom talking, he prolonged his Meals.</p>
                     <p>But as every one called to mind the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Birth, and former Life, and on the other hand, obſerved his Cruelty, which
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52508:177"/> was exceſſive, and the many horrid things that he did, which the Soldiers, eſpecially, very well knew, they were not able longer to endure ſuch a Nuſance upon the Throne, and ſo they reſolved to rid themſelves of him.</p>
                     <p>There was a Libel once made upon his<note place="margin">A Libel upon him.</note> Son to this purpoſe. <hi>I dreamt I ſaw a Youth of the Name of</hi> Antoninus, <hi>who hath a Slave to his Father, his Mother ſuch a Whore, ſhe hath had a Hundred, and ask'd a Hundred more. From ſuch a Father, ſuch a Mother, let him be a</hi> Pius <hi>or a</hi> Marcus, <hi>he cannot be a</hi> Verus Antoninus; alluding to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Name of <hi>Verus,</hi> but intending to to ſay, that he cannot be a true, but only a viſionary, and a Baſtard <hi>Antoninus.</hi> When <hi>Macrinus</hi> was told this, he anſwered it in ſome <hi>Iambics,</hi> which they ſay were very well done; but we have them not, becauſe they periſhed with him in the Fray that he was kill'd in, when all that he had was plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Soldiers.</p>
                     <p>The manner of his Death was ſuch as we have repreſented it before already; that is, his Army revolting, and carrying all their Inclinations upon <hi>Antoninus Heliogabalus,</hi> he fled, and was afterwards taken and kill'd in a Village of <hi>Bithynia;</hi> his Attendants all yielding, or otherwiſe cut in pieces or diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in flight. This made <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> famous, becauſe he appeared to have revenged the Death of his Father. So he ſucceeded to
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52508:177"/> the Empire, and as he certainly diſgraced it afterwards with Vices of Luxury, Impurity, Riot, Pride, and Cruelty, and as he lived an unhappy Life, ſo he met with the like tragical Death.</p>
                     <p>This is what I have diſcover'd concerning <hi>Macrinus,</hi> out of a great many Hiſtorians that mention him. I humbly preſent it to your Majeſty, O <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> being aſſured, that your Majeſty takes a pleaſure in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Accounts of the Emperors of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Times.</p>

                        <hi>ANtoninus Diadumenus</hi> being but a Youth when the Army created him Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, together with his Father, after the Death of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus;</hi> his Life affords us little that is remarkable, more than the Account of his reception of the Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and the ſtupendious Omens that appeared to fore-tell his Reign, and alſo that it was to continue but a ſhort time. For as to the firſt, as ſoon as it was known amongſt
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:52508:178"/> the Legions, that the fatal Stroke was given to <hi>Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> that which was a matter of great trouble to them all, to obſerve, was, that they had not another <hi>Antoninus</hi> to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, as if they thought that the very <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was certainly to periſh with that Name. <hi>Macrinus</hi> hearing this, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by reaſon that there were ſeveral Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> that were Captains in the Army, leſt the Army might caſt their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations upon ſome one or other of thoſe, for the Empire; he immediately put himſelf at the Head of them, with this Harangue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You ſee here, my Fellow Soldiers, my ſelf, and my</hi>

                           <hi>He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared an</hi> Antoninus</note> 
                        <hi>Son</hi> Diadumenus. <hi>I am well advanced in years, but my Son by the mercy of the Gods, you will have long to be your Emperor. I underſtand that there is remaining amongſt you, a great Affection for the Name of</hi> Antoninus. <hi>Wherefore ſince for my own part, according to the Condition of humane Frailty, I have not much time left me to live, I name this young Son, an</hi> Antoninus, <hi>with your Conſents, and wiſh you long to enjoy him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They cried, <hi>The Gods ſave the Emperor</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus. <hi>The Gods ſave</hi> Antoninus Diadumenus. <hi>We all beg, that</hi> Antoninus Caracallus <hi>may be made a God.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Macrinus</hi> replied, <hi>My Fellow Soldiers, we give you a Bounty of three pieces of Gold, to each of you, upon the occaſion of our Acceſſion to the Empire; and for the Name of</hi> Antoninus, <hi>five pieces of Gold more, beſides your ordinary Pay, which ſhall be doubled to you. The Gods grant that this may be done often; for as much as we now give you this day, we will repeat it to you, every Fifth year of our Reigns.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Speech to the Army.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Antoninus Diadumenus</hi> the young Emperor ſpoke to them in theſe words. <hi>I thank you, my Fellow Soldiers, for the Honour of the Empire, and of the name which you have given me, for it is you that have thought my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and me, worthy to be the Emperors of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to command the State: to the Government whereof My Father will take the Care not to be wanting, and it ſhall be my beſt endeavours not to be wanting to the Glory of the name of</hi> Antoninus. <hi>I am ſenſible, it is a name in which the Emperors</hi> Pius, Marcus, <hi>and</hi> Verus, <hi>have gone before me: who were Perſons, to whom it is a difficult thing to anſwer worthily. I can only ſay, I will do all that is in my power: and in the mean time, upon the joynt occaſion of my Reign and my Name, I promiſe you the ſame, as my moſt honoured Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath done; who hath but conſidered you at you deſerve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtorian <hi>Herodian,</hi> hath omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe paſſages, and ſpeaks <hi>Diadumenus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no higher a quality than a <hi>Caeſar.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever after this Harangue, a Coin was
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:52508:179"/> ſtamped at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the name of <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Diadumenus:</hi> the other, which was to be in the name of <hi>Macrinus</hi> was deferred, till they had the expreſs Orders of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; to whom Letters were ſent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them, with what was paſt, and with the New <hi>Antoninus,</hi> who deſired their approbation. And whether it was as ſome ſay, becauſe their hatred to <hi>Antoninus Caracallus</hi> made them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have any other Emperor, rather than him, they accepted of this Change freely. Had <hi>Macrinus</hi> lived, he intended to have given to the People of <hi>Rome</hi> a Preſent of ſome <hi>Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> after the example of the Donation of <hi>Caracallus:</hi> and alſo to eſtabliſh a Charity, for the maintenace of the Children of ſome Poor Families; whom he intended to call by the name of his Son; to the end, as his own Words in the Edict are, to render ſo much the more agreeable and more recommendable the glory of the name of <hi>Antoninus.</hi> At the ſame time, he ſays, that he wiſhes that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> that his Son, their new <hi>Antoninus,</hi> might with his own hand diſtribute a Largeſs of Corn amongſt them. In the next place he ordered the Colours, and the Standards of the <hi>Antoninuſſes</hi> to be put up in the Camp. He erected the Statues of <hi>Antoninus Baſſianus Caracallus,</hi> in Gold and Silver; and Celebrated a Feſtival of ſeven days, for the Honour of the name of <hi>Antoninus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:52508:180"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antoninus Diadumenus</hi> was certainly one of<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</note> the beautifulleſt Youths in the World. He was pretty tall, with bright yellow Hair, black Eyes, and a pretty long Noſe; his Chin perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handſome, and a grace to his whole Face; a full kiſſing Lip, and then he was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stout, and proper in his Exerciſes. When firſt he was dreſs'd in the Imperial Robes of Scarlet and Purple, and the other Military En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Empire; he ſhined like a Star, or as one newly dropt from Heaven, and every body loved him, for the Charms of his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, as to the Omens which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticated<note place="margin">Omens of his Reign.</note> his Reign, they are indeed ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous. The day that he was born, his Father over-ſeeing and examining the Purple Robes of the Emperor in his Office, had ordered ſome of them to be brought where his Son <hi>Diadumenus</hi> was born in two Hours after. And as ſome Children that are born, have a skin upon their Heads in the nature of a Coif, being a natural ſort of a Cover upon the Head, which is afterwards taken away by the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives; <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> inſtead of this had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Diadem in the place of it, which was a thin, but ſtrong Fleſh, made of a great many Veins and Fibres, like the ſtrings of a Bow, from whence he was called at firſt <hi>Diadematus;</hi> but as he grew up, he was called by the Name of <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> from his Grandfather by the ſide of his Mother; and there is not much difference betwixt the one Name and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At a Houſe of his Father's in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52508:180"/> twelve Lambs were kidded, all of a Wool of the colour of Purple, except one, which was of divers Colours. The ſame day that he was born, an Eagle came and dropt a Ring-Dove into his Cradle as he ſlept, and retired without doing him any hurt. Other Doves, from whence the Soothſayers prognoſticated great Riches and Honour, came and made their Neſts in his Father's Houſe. As he was one day walking in the Fields, an Eagle came and took from off his Head his Cap, and afterwards dropt it upon the Head of a Statue of an Emperor. He was born, not only upon the ſame day of the Month, but in the ſame hour, and almoſt under the ſame Conſtellations, as was the Emperor <hi>Antoninus Pius.</hi> Therefore the Aſtrologers ſaid, <hi>That he would be both the Son of an Emperor, and an Emperor himſelf.</hi> A Woman, who was of his Kindred, obſerving that he was born upon the Birth-day of that Prince, cried, <hi>Let him be called an</hi> Antoninus. But <hi>Macrinus</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to do that, becauſe it was an Imperial Name, which none of his Family had ever had; and he thought it was ſafer to let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, eſpecially, the Report being already put about of the greatneſs of his Birth. Another Omen that ſtill more particularly deſerves our obſervation, is this; as <hi>Diadumenus</hi> was in his Cradle in a Garden, a Lyon that had broken looſe, and was very fierce, came and lick'd him, and left him without offering him the leaſt violence; but yet meeting his Nurſe, he fell upon her, and bit her ſo cruelly, that ſhe died.</p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:52508:181"/>
                     <p>This is what hath ſeemed to me to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of memory concerning <hi>Antoninus Diadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus,</hi> whoſe Life I had even intermixt with the Actions of his Father, but that my Honour for the Princes of his Name, obliged me to<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Great Honours paid to the Name</hi> Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> ſuch a particular Account of him. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it was a Name ſo amiable to theſe times, that it ſeems, as if he who was not call'd an <hi>Antoninus,</hi> was not fit to be Emperor. There is a Letter of <hi>Opilius Macrinus,</hi> in which he declares, that he glories not ſo much of his elevation to the Empire, whereof he was the ſecond Perſon in rank before, as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guards, as of being the Father of a Son, of the Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> which at that time was ſo Famous, that not any Name of the Gods themſelves was more. Therefore, ſaid one, <hi>It is a thing void of all Reaſon, and unſuitable to the Dignity of</hi> Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, <hi>to covet, as he did, the Name of</hi> Hercules, <hi>as if that of</hi> Antoninus <hi>was not Honour enough. For would he be a God, he could never more eminently be ſo, than as he was an Emperor of ſo excellent a Name?</hi> I mention this, in this place, only to ſhew, how highly the <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſſes</hi> were valued, to have their Names ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the very Gods. And yet all this was wrought by only the Charms of three Princes of that Name, whoſe Wiſdom, whoſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and whoſe Piety conſecrated them for ever to Poſterity; that is, Wiſdom in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> Goodneſs in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Verus,</hi> and Piety in the firſt of the three, <hi>Antoninus Pius.</hi> I come now to the Letter which I mention'd of <hi>Opilius Macrinus.</hi>

But the others were murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhamefully dragged, branded as Tyrants, their Names thought unworthy ſo much as to be mentioned; or not to be mentioned without horror. After the Death of <hi>Macrinus</hi> and his Son, the Empire was conferred upon <hi>Varius Antoninus Heliogabalus,</hi> for this reaſon eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, becauſed he was the reputed Son of <hi>Baſſianus Antoninus Caracallus.</hi> He had been<note place="margin">Reaſon of his Names.</note> before a Prieſt, either of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or the Sun, and had taken to himſelf the Name of <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi> not only for an Argument of his Birth, but becauſe he knew that that Name was ſo very dear to the World, that even the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide his Father was loved for its ſake. His other Name from his Grandfather <hi>Varia,</hi> was <hi>Varius.</hi> Then he called himſelf <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> from the Name of the God in the <hi>Phoenician</hi>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:52508:184"/> Language, whoſe Prieſt he was; and when he came to the Empire, he was declared an <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and he was the laſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors of that Name.</p>
                     <p>His Mother was <hi>Semiamira,</hi> to whom he was ſo devoted, that he did nothing in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without her. She in the mean time lived in the manner of an impudent Courtezan, and purſued her lewdneſſes of all ſorts in the very Palace. For as it was under that Character, that formerly <hi>Antoninus Caracallus</hi> had had commerce with her, ſo the promiſcuous Iſſue, her Son, might very well alſo be called <hi>Varius,</hi> if it had been only from thence, who after his Father was killed, fled, it is ſaid, for fear of <hi>Macrinus</hi> into the Temple of the God <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus,</hi> as into an <hi>Aſylum,</hi> and made his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood there his Protection. But thus much as to his Name; that holy Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> ſo pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by this Man, but which is, however, ſo venerated by you, Moſt Sacred <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that your Majeſty hath the greateſt Honour in the World for the Emperors <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antoninus;</hi> ſetting them before you, no leſs than you do <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> for your Royal Imitation; whereby you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed adopt the Virtues of the Antients to be your own, and certainly they very well ſuit with the happy Inclinations of your Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>After then, <hi>Varius Antoninus Heliogabalus</hi> was in the poſſeſſion of the Empire, he ſent his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of it to <hi>Rome,</hi> where all the Orders of the Nobility, Gentry and People being eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Name of an <hi>Antoninus,</hi> which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

So when the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was read in the Senate, they received it with as many Acclamations of Joy and Kindneſs to him, as on the other hand they inveighed againſt <hi>Macrinus</hi> and his Son.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:52508:185"/> ſhould be worſhipped at <hi>Rome</hi> but his own. He ſaid, that he would command the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to be thither alſo transferred; that the Myſteries of all Religions ſhould be contained within the Temple, and applied to the Honour of <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt day afterwards that the Senate ſat,<note place="margin">His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſits with the Senate.</note> he cauſed his Mother to be admitted as a Member of that Aſſembly, who was called in, and came and took her place by the Seats of the Conſuls, and was preſent at the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a Decree of the Senate. Indeed, he is the only Perſon of all the Emperors, whoſe Reign hath given us a Senatreſs; a Woman to come into the Senate, to act as a Man. He alſo created a little Senate of Women, which met on <hi>Collis Quirinalis;</hi> whoſe Decrees, aſſembled under the Direction of <hi>Semiamira,</hi> and the Laws that they made concerning the Ladies are very diverting. They made Laws, <hi>What Cloaths every one ſhould wear; who ſhould give place to whom; who ſalute whom; who go in a Coach; who ride upon a Horſe; who upon an Aſs; who go in a Litter, drawn by Mules; who to be drawn by Oxen; who carried in a Chair, and whether the Chair ſhould be of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or inlaid with Bone, or Braſs, or Ivory, or Damaskt with Silver; and who ſhould wear Gold or Jewels at their Shoes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilſt he wintered in the City of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> which was before his coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he carried himſelf ſo lewdly there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carnally enter'd by Men, and grunting at
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:52508:186"/> the Work, like a Sow that is brimmed, that the Soldiers ſoon repented themſelves of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſpired againſt <hi>Opilius Macrinus</hi> to make this Perſon a Prince; and then turned their Thoughts upon <hi>Alexander</hi> a Couſin-German of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> whom the Senate had created <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon the Death of <hi>Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> For who indeed could endure to ſee a Prince more than beſtial, leaving no conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity<note place="margin">His Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiality.</note> of his Body unpolluted by thoſe he loved. And coming afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> he made it his great Buſineſs to be furniſhed with Men out of all Parts that were the beſt provided for his purpoſe. He had the Comedy of <hi>Paris</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in his Apartments, in which himſelf acted the part of the <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſuddenly his Cloaths falling down to his Heels, and leaving his Body all naked, he put himſelf into a Poſture fit for his Aſſociates to make their lewd Approaches. He made himſelf to be drawn in the figure of a <hi>Venus,</hi> with a delicate Face, and all his Body ſmooth, and thought it the greateſt Happineſs of his Life to be tempting and agreeable to the Luſts of more and more Men.</p>
                     <p>Himſelf, his Servants, and his Pimps, one<note place="margin">His baſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> with another, made a common Sale of the Degree and Places of Honour, and the Places of Power and Command. He created any one indifferently a Senator for Money, without regard to Age, Eſtate, or Birth. The Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Offices of Captains, Tribunes and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, were ſold, as alſo the Governments of the Provinces, and the Offices of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:52508:186"/> Two Coach-men, whom he took out of the Cirque, that is, <hi>Protogenes</hi> and <hi>Gordius,</hi> he made the great Companions of his Life, and his Privadoes to every thing he did. He took ſeveral into the Court out of both the Theatre and the Amphitheatre, where they had been Players, Charioteers, or Gladiators, only becauſe their Bodies promiſed him to the Eye, ſomething filthy that pleaſed him. He loved a Youth called <hi>Hierocles</hi> ſo, that he uſed to kiſs what it is immodeſt to name in him, and ſaid, <hi>That it was to celebrate a Game to the Goddeſs</hi> Flora. He committed Inceſt upon<note place="margin">His Inceſt and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</note> a Veſtal Nun. He profaned the moſt Holy Rites and Myſteries of the <hi>Romans,</hi> breaking into the Sacriſties of their Temples, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying all things away thence into that of his own God. He would have extinguiſhed the perpetual Veſtal Fire. Nor was he only this upon the Religions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but all the World over, he deſired to have no other God worſhipped but <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi> He broke into the Sanctuary of the Temple of the Goddeſs <hi>Veſta,</hi> polluted as he was, with all kind of Filthineſs, and his Company as bad and as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as he, to take from thence the inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Image of <hi>Pallas.</hi> He thought that he had really carried off the Jar which is conſecrated to the Temple, and the Rites of the Goddeſs <hi>Cybele;</hi> but only the ſuperior of the Virgins belonging to that Goddeſs, had ſhewn him a falſe one in the room of the true; and finding nothing in it that was extraordinary, he broke it in pieces. So he alſo ſeized upon an Image
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:52508:187"/> of <hi>Pallas;</hi> which was adorned with Gold; but which he likewiſe miſtook for the true Palladium, and he placed it in the Temple of his own God. He initiated himſelf in the Rites of the Goddeſs <hi>Cybele;</hi> and was waſhed in Bull's Blood; only to get an opportunity by the means to ſteal away the Image of that Goddeſs, and other Sacred Utenſils that are kept altogether lockt up. He toſſed his Head and his Hair about, as the Fanatick Prieſts of that Goddeſs do, amongſt whom he offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated: every thing that thoſe Prieſts do, ſo did he; till at length, he ſtole off the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Image of the <hi>Mother of the Gods,</hi> and repoſed it in the Sacriſty of his own God. He Celebrated the Feaſts of <hi>Adonis,</hi> with all the Mourning and the Toſſing the Body, which is uſed in the worſhip of that God in <hi>Syria.</hi> He imitated <hi>Venus,</hi> weeping and bewailing his loſs; which was but a preſage from himſelf of his own approaching ruin. All the Gods, he ſaid, were the Servants of his God; to whom ſome were his Chamberlains, ſome his Uſhers, and others, were deſtin'd to ſerve him in all ſorts of Offices. He endeavoured to poſſeſs himſelf of the Statue of the Goddeſs <hi>Diana;</hi> being the ſame Sacred Statue which <hi>Oreſtes</hi> had ſtoln out of her Temple in <hi>Scythia Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and had afterwards repoſed it in another Temple Dedicated to her at the City of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi> The ſame <hi>Oreſtes</hi> built a City of his own Name, <hi>Oreſta,</hi> upon the Bank of the <hi>Hebrus,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Thrace;</hi> which the Emperor <hi>Hadrian</hi> ordered to be re-called <hi>Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople,</hi>

And yet all falſe; as all theſe ſort of Men do, who when admitted to too great a Familiarity with Princes, make no ſcruple to Sacrifice the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of them to their own advantages: Let the Princes themſelves be bad or good, it is the ſame; for ſo long as either through their Folly, or their Innocence, they do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Cheat; it is Meat and Drink, and Honour, and Riches to ſuch as purſue it. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus</hi> perfectly Married this Man, and lay with him as his Bride; and his word was, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, Magirus:</hi> not bating him ſo much as the time that <hi>Magirus</hi> was ſick of a Doſe that had been palmed upon him by an angry Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.

The Graver Men bluſhing ſtill, and ſaying nothing, becauſe either their Age or their Honour refuted ſuch Stuff, he proceeded to apply his Diſcourſes to the young Fry, to whom he uttered all ſorts of filthy Queſtions; who anſwering him again ſuch things, as come from thoſe of their Years: he was mightily diverted, and ſaid, <hi>This now is to be free, and this is the right way of keeping the Feaſt of the Vintage.</hi> There were thoſe in the Company that were lewd enough, and ſome too that were old, and in appearance

                     <p>He preferred one Man to be a Captain of<note place="margin">Prefers baſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> the Guards, who had been a Publick Stage-Dancer at <hi>Rome.</hi> He made <hi>Gordius,</hi> a Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Captain of the Lieutenancy of the City: he made <hi>Claudius,</hi> a Barber, the Commiſſary of the Stores, and to other Places he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted Men as they recommended themſelves to him by the large ſize of their Secrets. He made a Mule-driver a Commiſſioner of the Tax, called <hi>Viceſima,</hi> together with a Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Cook, and a Lockſmith. When he came either to the Camp or the Senate, it was in the Company of his Mother, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority kept him a little in Countenance, and who was the firſt Woman, as we have ſaid, that ever had that acceſs to the Senate, to give her Vote there. At his Banquets he particularly loved to place by himſelf, and to Favour, the Bardaſhes; and took a great delight to Handle them, and to Provoke their Luſts, though it was before all the Company.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed, he conceived a great diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> his Couſin <hi>German,</hi> whom before he had Adopted; and yet it was only, becauſe he would not be as lewd as he. He ordered him to be removed from
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52508:190"/> him; and repented that he had adopted him, and ordered the Senate to Depoſe him from the Dignity and Title of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But as <hi>Alexander</hi> was a very excellent Youth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to both the Senate and all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and beloved by the Soldiers, as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved himſelf worthy thereof afterwards in his Reign, the Senate when this motion was made to them, was very ſilent upon it.

In order to which, he retired himſelf from the Palace, to the Gardens by the old Temple of <hi>Hope;</hi> as if he had deſigned that Place, in the way of an <hi>Omen,</hi> that he might ſucceed in his Hopes againſt this ſo promiſing, and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a Youth; whom he left behind him, in the Palace, in Company with his Mother and his Grandmother; and had commanded that he ſhould be killed there. At the ſame time he ſent Orders to the Camp to abrogate, amongſt them, his Title and Honour of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi> He ſent Perſons to beſmear with Dirt his Statues, which were in the Camp; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the Inſcriptions upon them, as it is done uſually to the Statues of Traitors. He ſent to others, that were his Attendants, to engage them by promiſes of Rewards and Honour, to kill him by what way ſoever they pleaſed; either in the Bath, or by Poiſon, or the Sword.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Counſels of the Wicked are of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect againſt the Innocent.</hi> No Body by any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, could be prevailed with, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of a Fact ſo Villainous. On the contrary, all his Weapons recoiled againſt
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52508:190"/> himſelf; and thoſe Perſons, by whom he aimed to take away <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Life, became the Maſters of his own. All the Soldiers were in a Flame to ſee the Statues and the Titles of <hi>Alexander</hi> beſmeared with Dirt. Some made towards the Palace, ſome towards the Gardens in which <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was; directly to aſſert the Cauſe of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to drive away this Impure Man, and in his Heart a Murderer, by violence from the Throne. Coming to the Palace, they firſt took a care of the preſervation of the Perſon of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and his Mother, and Grandmother; and ſent them to the Camp; whither <hi>Semiamira</hi> the Mother of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> followed them on Foot, in a great diſquiet for her Son, and to ſee what ſhe was able to effect in his Favour. From the Palace, they went to the Houſe where <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was. They found him employed about a Match for a Chariot-Race; but withal full of expectation of the News, when it ſhould come, that his Counſin-German was killed. The ſudden Noiſe of the Soldiers frightned him. He threw himſelf into a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by the help of a Curtain hanging over a Chamber-door, eſcaped out of their ſight. So he diſpatched one of the Captains of the Guards immediately to the Camp to appeaſe the Soldiers there; and another to ſweeten thoſe, that were come into the Houſe. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochianus</hi> was he who was employed to the latter: who ſpoke to them, and upon their Oaths Conjured them to be ſatisfied, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them ſo kindly, that in fine he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them (they not being very many in
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:52508:191"/> number) to abandon their Enterpriſe for that time. As to the other Officer, who was ſent to appeaſe the Camp, the Soldiers there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to him; that they were willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give <hi>Heliogabalus;</hi> provided that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Impure Men, and the Charioteers, and Stage-Players from his Perſon, and would betake himſelf to Reaſon: particularly they deſired the removal of ſuch as had made uſe of their Miniſtry for a Cloak to Cheat all the World out of their Money. So <hi>Hierocles, Gordius, Muriſſimus,</hi> and two more of his Lewd<note place="margin">A Mutiny of the Soldiers appeaſed.</note> Favourites; who as ill as he was, made him much worſe, by the abſolute power which they had over him, were removed. The Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers further deſired, that the Captains of the Guards ſhould take care not to ſuffer him to lead ſo ill a life again; and that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould be preſerved in ſafety from him, and not be viſited by any neither of his Company; becauſe no Taint of their filthineſs or example ſhould reach his imitation. But yet <hi>Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> not only inſtantly redemanded <hi>Hierocles,</hi> who was one that was moſt extremely Lewd; but he daily carried on deſigns againſt the life of the young Prince. Upon the Calends of <hi>January,</hi> when they both were appointed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls together, he refuſed to appear with him in the Proceſſion, according to Cuſtom, to the Senate, and the Capitol: till at laſt his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, and his Mother told him, that the Soldiers were ready to Murder him, unleſs he agreed better with his Couſin, German; and then, though it was twelve a Clock, firſt he
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:52508:191"/> put on his Robes, and marched to the Senate; whither his Mother repaired in a Chair at the ſame time: but he would by no means be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to go from thence to the Capitol to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Ceremony, and to perform the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Vows and Rites there. For all things were done there by the Governour of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as in the caſe of the abſence of both the Conſuls.</p>
                     <p>Nor did he ſtill forbear to proſecute his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt the life of <hi>Alexander.</hi> But in the mean time fearing, that after he had killed him, the Senate would in return caſt their thoughts upon another Emperor, he reſolved to be before hand with them, and on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he baniſhed the Senate out of the City. All<note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</note> of them though their Chariots or Servants were wanting, and their Equipages not in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, were commanded nevertheleſs immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be gone. So they went; ſome of them upon Carts, and others by any manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, that Chance offered to them. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,</hi> who had been a Conſul, and one to whom <hi>Ulpian</hi> the Lawyer Dedicates his Books, tarrying a little behind the reſt, he ſent for a Centurion, and commanded him to kill him. But ſpeaking it ſomething low, and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion being a little deaf, the Centurion thought that his command had been to drive him out of the Town by force: which he did, and the miſtake ſaved <hi>Sabinus</hi> his life. At the ſame time he Baniſhed <hi>Ulpian,</hi> for no other reaſon, but becauſe he was an Honeſt Man, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Rhetorician <hi>Silvinus,</hi> who had been
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:52508:192"/> 
                        <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Maſter; and the latter he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put to death: but <hi>Ulpian</hi> was ſpared.</p>
                     <p>But the Soldiers, and eſpecially thoſe of the Guards, knowing what <hi>Rods</hi> Heliogabalus <hi>was making for their Backs,</hi> and obſerving the grudge that he bore them, for their laſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, in which they had reſcued <hi>Alexander</hi> out of his Hands, reſolved upon a Conſpiracy with one another, for the deliverance of the State. Accordingly they fell firſt upon his Lewd Aſſociates; whom they put to death in ſeveral ways; ſome by ripping them up, and taking out their Entrails; ſome by boring them through the Fundament; that their deaths and<note place="margin">His Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates and himſelf ſlain.</note> their lifes ſhould be alike. Next they broke by violence in upon himſelf; who fled for ſhelter into a Houſe of Office. They killed him there; then they dragged him through the Streets. They added this Deſpite to his Body that they threw it into the Kennel; and the Kennel not being big enough for it, they faſtned a weight to it, that it ſhould not float and be afterwards found, and buryed, and ſo caſt it from the <hi>Aemilian</hi> Bridge into the River of <hi>Tyber.</hi> But before they threw him into the <hi>Tyber,</hi> they had dragged him up and down the Cirque. His Name, that is, that of <hi>Antoninus</hi> was eraſed, and nothing but that of <hi>Varius Heliogabalus</hi> was left to ſtand upon the Records, becauſe he had ſo much affected, to retain nothing but the Name, to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Son of an <hi>Antoninus.</hi> They called him after his death, the <hi>Tyberine, Drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, Impure Heliogabalus,</hi> and by many other
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:52508:192"/> ſuch Names, upon any occaſion of remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſſages of his Reign. Of all the Princes, he was the only one that was both dragged and thrown into the Kennel, and thrown into the <hi>Tyber</hi> too. It was what befel him from the general hatred in which he died, and which Princes by his Example ought to take great heed how they incur; becauſe, if ſo be that they live ſo, as not to merit the Love of either the Senate, People, or Soldiers; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be thought to deſerve the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be buried. His publick Works were,<note place="margin">Hsi pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Works.</note> he built a Temple to his God <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> whom ſome interpret the Sun, ſome <hi>Jupiter.</hi> He repaired the Amphitheatre after a Fire. He carried on the Work of the Baths, that had been begun by his Father, but which had been left imperfect for want of ſome Galleries to them, which therefore this Prince enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but neither were thoſe brought unto their laſt perfection till the Reign of <hi>Alexander Severus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was the laſt of the Princes of the Name of <hi>Antoninus.</hi> And certainly the Life, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and the Lewdneſs of him are ſo odious, that as the Senate eraſed out of the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords his Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> my ſelf ſhould not give it him, but for the ſake of diſtinction, and the Laws of Hiſtory, which oblige me. His Mother <hi>Semiamira</hi> was killed with him; a Woman without Honour, and worthy of ſuch a Son; upon whoſe account, it was before all things ordained by the Senate, after his Death, that no Woman for the future ſhould ever be
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:52508:193"/> received a Member there again, and the Head of him by whom this had been done, contrary to the Sentiments of all the World, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to Hell for it. Many were the obſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Life, which I think not fit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His Riot in ſome things, when a private Man, and in others when Emperor, and what concerns his Luxury in that kind, I may the better deſcribe. For even in his private Life, he profeſſed to imitate the Luxury of <hi>Apicius;</hi> and when Emperor, his Examples were <hi>Nero, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was the firſt of all private Men, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered<note place="margin">His Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury in his Houſe.</note> his Bed with furniture of Cloth of Gold, which he did in virtue of an Act, that had admitted it of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> when that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror made an Auction of all the unneceſſary moveables of his Houſhold to raiſe Money for the <hi>Marcomannick</hi> War. He garniſhed his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments throughout the Summer, with Glaſſes and things, all of the ſame colour, and the colour every day various. He was the firſt that furniſhed his Kitchin with Pots and Pans of Silver, whereof ſome were of a hundred pound weight, and ingraved with venereal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. He firſt brought up the Wines of the infuſion of Maſtick, Roſes, and other things, which the Luxurious have at this day. For though the Wine of the infuſion of Roſes had been invented before, yet he rendred that ſtill more fragrant by a mixture in it of the Pine. Neither do we read of ſo many ſeveral mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Wines before the time of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> every moment of whoſe Life was ſpent in
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:52508:193"/> queſt of new Pleaſures. He is the firſt that made a ſort of Saulages of Fiſh, ſuch as Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Muſcles, Lobſters, Crabs, Shrimps. His Dining Rooms, Tables, Couches, and Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries where he eat or walked, were ſtrewed with Roſes, Lilies, Violets, Hyacinths, Daffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dils, and all ſorts of Flowers. He went not into the Baths, but they were firſt perfumed with noble Oyntments, or Saffron. The Pallets, upon which he repoſed himſelf at Table, were of the Skins of Hares, or the Feathers of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, and he often changed his leaning Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows for ſoftneſs. Sometimes he vilified the Senate ſo, that he called them <hi>Slaves of the long Robe;</hi> and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>poor Labourers of one Field;</hi> and ſlighted the <hi>Eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian</hi> Order, as worth nothing. He often took the Governor of the City, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Guards, to drink with him after Supper, and ſpared them not their meaſure. He had deſigned, if he had lived, to appoint a diſtinct Governour to every Region of the City, in all fourteen, which was to be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment for ſo many of his Pimps, the filthieſt of Men, and of the baſeſt profeſſion of Life. He had Couches of Maſſy Silver, both for his Dining-Rooms and his Chambers. He was ſerved with Diſhes frequently in imitation of the Luxury of <hi>Apicius,</hi> of the <hi>Hoofs of Camels, the Combs of Cocks cut off from them alive, and the Tongues of Peacocks and Nightingals;</hi> becauſe he ſaid, <hi>Theſe are good things againſt an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſie.</hi> He taught the Court the Dainties of the <hi>Intrails of Barbels, the Brains of Red Tails.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:52508:194"/> the Eggs of Partridges, the Brains of Thruſhes and the Heads of Parrets, Pheaſants, and Peacocks.</hi> It is to be admired, how he gathered together ſuch a quantity of the Fins of Barbels, that he had great Diſhes and large Plates ſerved of them, being things as rare as they are uſeleſs. And which is altogether aſtoniſhing, he fed his Dogs with the Livers of Geeſe.</p>
                     <p>Lions and Leopards, being firſt diſarmed of<note place="margin">Other of his immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.</note> their Claws and Teeth, and taught by Maſters to be tame, and to know their Commands, he had a great delight in. And at the ſecond or third Services, on a ſudden, he called them into the Room to him, where the Company not knowing that they were diſarmed, it was a mighty laughing matter to him to ſee what a vain Fright it gave them. He ſent Raiſins in the Sun to be put into the Mangers to his Horſes. He ſed his Lions and his other fierce Beaſts, with Parrets and Pheaſants. For ten days together, he had once every day ſerved up to him thirty of the Meats that are made of the hinder Part of ſo many Sows newly far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed. His Peaſe were garniſhed with Grains of Gold. His Lentils with precious Stones, which matched them. His Beans with Beads of Amber, and his Rice with Pearl. Pearl was ſprinkled amongſt his Fiſh and his Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms, like ſo much white Pepper. He ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtifled ſome of his Company at Table, with the vaſt number of Violets, and other Flowers, made by a Contrivance to fall upon their Heads.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid, that he repreſented a Fight of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:52508:194"/> Gallies in the Amphitheatre, <hi>upon a Sea all of, Wine,</hi> which was let in by the Pipes. At the ſame time he perfumed the Seats for the People, with ſweet Oyntments. He ran a Race of four Chariots drawn by four Elephants a piece, upon the <hi>Vatican,</hi> being himſelf the Driver, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling the ground for the purpoſe; and another within the Circuit of his Palace, of as many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels drawing the Chariots. He once ordered a great quantity of Serpents to be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for him; ſo when he had them, he let them fly ſuddenly amongſt the Company that was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the Cirque at a publick Shew, of whom many were bitten, and others put to the ſcamper to ſave themſelves. He had ſome Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks ſo thick beſet with Jewels, that he ſaid, <hi>He was even loaded with the eight of his finery.</hi> He wore at his Shoes, Jewels of the Cut of the greateſt Artiſts, which was but thought ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; as if the fineneſs of the Stone, and the gravery, ſignified at the Foot any thing where it could not be diſtinguiſhed. He dreſſed his Head with Jewels, to make him look more of the Countenance of a Lady. He made great Ponds of Sea-water in the inland Parts at a great diſtance from the Sea, and filled them with Fiſh from the Sea. He had Mountains of Snow in Summer preſerved for him, which was fetched from all Parts. He never would eat Fiſh near the Sea; but in places at a very great diſtance from the Sea, he would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſerved with the Curioſities of the Sea; and treated the very Ruſticks there with the ſoft Roes of Lampries and Sturgeons.</p>

                     <p>His Fiſh was dreſſed with an Art, that when they were brought upon the Table, they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if they were alive, juſt taken out of the Water. He bathed and ſwam in Ponds of Aromatick Wine, which were filled in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant for him, and ſprinkled with the Flowers of Roſes; himſelf and all the People drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wine of the Ponds, and his Seat in them perfumed with exquiſite Nard. For his Lamps, he had of the Oyl of Balm. He never lay with the ſame Woman twice, unleſs it was his Wife. His Houſe was a Bawdy-houſe for all his Company, Friends and Servants. His Suppers never coſt leſs than one hundred thouſand Seſterces; and ſometimes reckoning all things, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

He it did the ſumptuous Suppers both of <hi>Apicius</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Vitellius.</hi> His Fiſhing-Nets were drawn out of the Ponds, by a Yoke of Oxen. He tied ſome of his poor Retainers ſometimes to a Wheel which went under Water; in which, giving them a good plunge, and then up again, he ſaid, <hi>Thoſe were his Friends of the Race of</hi> Ixion. He pav'd the Courts before the Palace, with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedamonian</hi> and <hi>Porphyry</hi> Marble, which was alſo yet in being in our memory, and but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up and changed. He had deſigned to give to the City a large Column, having an aſcent within it to the top, where he intended to place the God <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi> But though he propoſed to fetch the Stone from <hi>Thebais</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he could not be provided with a Rock that was great enough for his Work.</p>

                     <p>He many times had an humor, when his<note place="margin">His vain Frolicks.</note> Company was well in drink, to lock them up, and in the Night on a ſudden to ſend in Lions, Leopards, and Bears (diſarmed) into the Room to them; that when they awaked in the Morning, or which was worſe, in the Night, and found themſelves in the ſame Room with Lions, Bears and Panthers, they were ſometimes, ſtruck dead with the fright. As to others of his Gueſts of an inferiour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he placed them upon Sacks about the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, filled only with Wind, which being let out ſuddenly, they were thrown down in an inſtant at the foot of the Table, with their Meat in their Mouths.

He pickt up all the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Pleaſure that he could find about the Cirque, the Play-houſe, the Race, the Baths, and wherever they were; and aſſembling them all together in ſome publick Houſe, he made an Harangue to them in the Phraſe of <hi>my Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Soldiers,</hi> as it was a General ſpeaking to his Army, and then he treated upon the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with them concerning the ſeveral ſorts of Poſtures and infamous Pleaſures. Next he had the like Conference with all the Pimps and laſcivious Catamites, old and young, that were to be gotten from all Parts. he dreſſed himſelf in the Habit of a Lady, being to meet theſe, with his Breaſts bare; and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his Speech to them, he promiſed them for their Encouragement, as if they were ſo many old Soldiers that had well ſerved in his Cauſe, a Donative of three pieces of Gold each, deſiring them to pray to the Gods, to make him happy in the good encreaſe of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                     <p>He commanded his Servants upon a piece of Work which is ſufficiently ridiculous, and yet he did it with promiſes to them of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their care and pains in it, which was this; that they ſhould bring him a thouſand pound weight of Spiders. He had gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at length, by this means, no leſs than ten times that weight; from whence he ſaid, it was eaſie to make a Judgment of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:52508:196"/> of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> He ſent the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of his Kitchin to ſome with Veſſels, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be full of Proviſion that he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them with; but when they were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were found full of Frogs, Scorpions, Serpents and Flies. Dining, or ſupping he had continually Chariot-Races run before the Rooms and Galleries, where he was; in which he obliged old Men, and ſome of the moſt honourable too, to mount the Box, for the greater diverſion. He ordered ten thouſand Mice, one thouſand Weaſels, and another thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of Rats to be gathered together, and ſhewn to him at once. He often tantalized his poor Retainers, with Mock-Dinners, done all in Glaſs, or Wax, or Ivory, or Earthen Ware; upon their Tables and their Napkins, they had Services curiouſly repreſented in Paintings, all which did not hinder them, but they might ſtarve for Hunger, and yet none dared to complain of the excellency of the Feaſt, but waſhed, and went away, as if they had dined never ſo well. He commanded that out of the publick Stores of Corn, which <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi> had amaſſed for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> for ſeven Years, at a certain Rate of ſo much a Year, there ſhould the allowances of two Years, be given to the Whores, Pimps, and Catamites about the Town; the firſt Year, to go to as many of them as lived within; the ſecond, to as many of them as lived without the Walls of the City.</p>

                     <p>He had ſometimes four great Dogs to draw his Chariot, as well after he was Emperor as before, when he was at his private Seat in the Country. He appeared at other times in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, drawn by four great Stags; at other times by Lions; and then he cauſed himſelf to be called the Mother of the Gods: Sometimes Tygers, and then he named himſelf <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whoſe Chariot is drawn by Tygers; and at the ſame time he habited himſelf as thoſe Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are repreſented, whom he imitated. He had at <hi>Rome</hi> of the little Dragons of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as alſo Sea-horſes, a Crocodile, a Rhinocerot, and of all the ſtrange Beaſts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be tranſported. Oſtriches were often a part of his Bill of Fare. He once entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the principal Perſons of the City, upon Seats all made of Saffron, which was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and to complement them, he ſaid, <hi>It was but Graſs in compariſon to what they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> He paſſed the Actions of the Day in the Night, and thoſe of the Night in the Day; eſteeming this as neceſſary a part of Luxury, as any thing. In the Evening he roſe, and received the Complements of the Court for that Day; when it was Morning, he went to Bed again. He daily preſented his Favourites with ſomething or other of importance. He ſuffered no one ſcarce to go from him, but he made him a Preſent, as if it was of a thing only that he had found, and that he did not value it ſo much, as to keep it himſelf.</p>

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:52508:197"/> were but ſilver'd over, or done with Ivory or Braſs. He ſometimes cauſed his Chariot to be drawn by naked, young, and very handſome Girls; two, or three, or four, or more of a Front; and as they were all naked, ſo for the moſt part was he. He had alſo this Cuſtom, to invite to his Banquets eight old Men, all with bald Heads; eight others blind of one Eye; eight others lame of the Gout; eight o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were Deaf; eight Blacks; eight o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were ſo fat, that their Table could ſcarce hold them; and then his Fancy was to make himſelf and the Court merry with them all round. All the ſilver Plate that was ſerved at his Banquets, and all the drinking Cups, and Side-board Veſſels, he gave away frankly amongſt the Company, and did this often. Then as a matter of great importance, he propoſed it to the Company, to invent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſome new Rules about Pickles, and Sawces, and fine Eating; they did ſo, and he whoſe Invention was pleaſing to his Palate, received for it a great Reward in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Silk, which at that time was a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and held in great Honour. But he whoſe Invention had diſpleaſed him, he deſired him to eat only always of that Diſh, till he ſhould find a better out. He was always placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Seat in the midſt of Flowers, and precious Odours. He loved nothing but what he was told, was very dear; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>the greatneſs of the Price raiſeth the Appetite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was a perfect <hi>Monſieur-Ragou</hi> in his Houſe, as alſo a Perfumer, a Vintner, and a Pimp,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:52508:198"/> and cauſed himſelf to be drawn in Pictures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. At one Supper he hath had the Heads of ſix hundred Oſtriches, for the ſake only of the Brains. Sometimes his Banquet was in this manner. He had two and twenty Services of all ſorts of Viands, whoſe Names at each Service, which was made in the order of the Letters of the Alphabet, began all with one and the ſame Letter. Then betwixt every Service they waſhed, and after that, every Man betook himſelf to his Miſtreſs; he and his Friends, and they were to ſwear, that it was not without an accompliſh'd Pleaſure. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, his Banquet was in this manner; he ordered each Service to be made ready at the Houſe of a ſeveral Friend, and as one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Capitol, another upon Mount <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine,</hi> another at a third place, another upon Mount <hi>Caelius,</hi> and another on the other ſide of the <hi>Tyber;</hi> the Company all went to every one's Houſe to eat each Service in order; and then waſhing at each Service and enjoying their Miſtreſſes, the whole day was ſcarce time enough for them to finiſh one Feaſt. Some ſay, that he built Baths in ſeveral Places, and only waſhed once in them, and then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately deſtroyed them, for fear of accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to any; and that he did the ſame with ſeveral Houſes and Apartments that he built. But I am apt to think, that thoſe things and many others, which exceed all belief are rather impoſed upon him by Perſons who have been willing entirely to blacken his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, only to make him ſo much the better foil for his Succeſſour.</p>

                     <p>It is ſaid, that he redeemed one Courteſan, who was very handſome, at the Price of a Hundred Thouſand Seſterces, and afterwards honoured her, as much, as if ſhe was a Virgin untouched. One asking him, whilſt he was a private Man, being then ſo Extravagant, if he did not fear the becoming Poor; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>What can I do better for my ſelf, than to be my own Heir, and the Heir of my Wife?</hi> However, he had Eſtates demiſed to him by a great many, in conſideration of his Father. He ſaid that he deſired to have no Children, for fear, that it ſhould make him a good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Inſtead of Coals, he burnt Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, Cinnamon, Caſſia, and other <hi>Indian</hi> Sweet-Woods for his Fires, in his Dining Rooms. He never when a private Man, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with leſs than a Train of ſixty Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages; which made his Grandmother many times to ſay of him, that he would ſpend all. But when Emperor, he never went but with a Train of ſix hundred; ſaying that the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> when he travels, employs Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Camels; and <hi>Nero</hi> had been attended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country with Fifteen Hundred Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots: The occaſion of which great Train of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> was the multitude of his Pimps, Bawds, Whores, Bardaſſes, and his filthy Crew of Men and Women, that he had always with him. Bathing he was always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Women; whom he moſt offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rubb'd and ſmooth'd, and took away their ſuperfluous Hair, with a depilatory Unguent, made for that purpoſe; and which,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:52508:199"/> after them, he uſed to himſelf, and took off his Beard with it: and after this, he with a Raſour, with his own Hand ſhaved, what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not modeſtly be ſpoken of; the Men alſo that he loved, and to whom he ſubjected his Body in the nature of a Miſtreſs; for the filthy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that he found in them. He ſtrewed one whole Gallery belonging to the Baths, all over with the Duſt of Gold and Silver; regretting that it could not be done with Amber too: and this he did often, whitherſoever he ſtirred out on Foot, if it was but to his Horſe, or to his Coach; as the Cuſtom is, to do it with the fineſt Sand to the Emperors at this day.</p>
                     <p>He never wore the ſame Pair of Shooes twice. It is denyed that he ever put on the ſame Rings twice. His beſt Robes he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tore and ſlaſhed in pieces. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Ships to be ſunk in the Port, that were come in from abroad, laden with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes; ſaying that this was a mark of a great Spirit. His Cloſeſtools were of Gold; and his Chamber Pots were of Alabaſter and Myrth. <hi>Had I,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Ever an Heir, I would appoint him ſuch a Governour, as ſhould oblige him to do all the things that I have done, or ſhall do.</hi> He had alſo this Cuſtom with him; that one day, he would have nothing at his Table but Pheaſants, and all his Services ſhould be of the fleſh of Pheaſants dreſt in ſeveral ways.

He often ſaid to his Company, that he had provided them Miſtreſſes of extraordinary Beauty to lie with; as they would find when they went to their Beds. But he ſent them to Bed in the dark, becauſe they ſhould not ſee their Faces, till the next Morning; and then, who were they, but old <hi>Negroe</hi> Women? He put the ſame Trick upon them, with <hi>Negroe</hi> Boys. He laughed ſo loud in Publick, that ſometimes in the Play-houſe, no body was heard but only he. He Sung, he Danced to the ſound of the Flute, he ſounded the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, he played upon the Shepheards Pipe, and touch'd very well the Organ. He hath gone about in one day to all the Whores of the Cirque, the Play-houſe, the Amphitheatre, and all parts of the City diſguiſed: and giving them, every one, ſome pieces of Gold in their Hand; without effecting any with them: ſays he, Antoninus <hi>gives you this, but tell no body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He invented certain new ways for his Luſts, in which he out-did the monſtrous Poſtures of all former times, and all the Conjunctions of <hi>Tiberius, Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero.</hi> His Fortune was<note place="margin">His death foretold.</note> foretold him by the Prieſts of <hi>Syria,</hi> that as he would be a great Profaner of the means that ſerve to Generation; ſo he ſhould one day come to dye by his own Hands.

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:52508:200"/> Poyſons, which he carried about him in Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, Jacynths, and other Pretious Stones, if any thing ill happened, that he could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe avoid, to Poyſon himſelf. He had built a very high Tower, with ſteps to it of Gold, enriched with pretious Stories, from whence to throw himſelf down headlong: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he would have his death,</hi> he ſaid, to be, <hi>as his life was, ſumptuous; there ſhould be a lively Image of Luxury in it; and it ſhould be ſaid, that no body had dyed ſo, as he.</hi> But all this ſignified nothing.

                        <hi>Your moſt Sacred Majeſty, O Conſtantine,</hi> will perhaps think it ſtrange, with others; that this Peſt, which I have given this account of, was ſuffered to Reign ſo long, as almoſt three whole years; and that none appeared in the mean time to reſcue out of his Hands the Honour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: becauſe in the Reigns of <hi>Nero, Caligula, Vitellius,</hi> and the reſt of the Princes of this ſtamp, there never wanted a Man to murder a Tyrant.

Your Majeſties Commands to me, to preſent you with this Life in its place, after the others which are antecedent to it, and which your Majeſty hath accepted, was an Authority abundant to me to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede all thoſe thoughts that had otherwiſe made me unwilling, and poſſeſſed me with a Reluctancy to meddle in a thing of this Nature. I ſhall now proceed to the Lives of thoſe that follow. The firſt of which is, that moſt excellent Prince, <hi>Alexander Severus;</hi> who was one of thirteen years Reign. Then there will be <hi>Aurelian,</hi> who was another excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince; and <hi>Claudius,</hi> of whom, being the Author of your Majeſty's Race, I ſhould be afraid to write the real Truth to you, leſt thoſe who have not all the reſpect that they ought, for the praiſes which are due to great
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:52508:201"/> Souls, ſhould pretend that I Flatter, if I did not know, that I ſhould be fully juſtified by others in all that I have to ſay. To theſe is to be added <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> the Father of an Age of Gold; and <hi>Maximian,</hi> the Father of an Iron Age, as they commonly call them; with all the reſt, to the Perſon of your Majeſty; whoſe Reign, I would ſay, Sir, yours, will be a Subject to employ the Eloquenteſt Pens, and happy are they to whom Nature is ſo kind, to have enabled them with gifts for ſo grand a Work. Nor yet are we to omit <hi>Licinius,</hi> or <hi>Marcus Aurelius Severus,</hi> or <hi>Maxentius;</hi> whoſe Rights are all devolved upon your Majeſty; and from whoſe Virtues we ought not to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate: For though it is the method of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Writers to take away from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful and the beaten Side, yet I ſhall think this an unfit thing to be done, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that when I ſhall have faithfully ſaid all the good of them, that I can find in our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs to be never ſo true, yet it will all but make ſo much the greater Acceſſion to your Glory.</p>

                     <p>AFter that Peſt of an Emperor, <hi>Varius Heliogabalus</hi> was killed, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally nothing of a true <hi>Antoninus</hi> in him; and therefore as the Senate, by their Authority, degraded him from that name, and eraſed it out of the Records, ſo neither am I
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:52508:202"/> very willing to give it him. <hi>Aurelius Alexander Severus</hi> his Couſin-German, who was Born at<note place="margin">His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> the City of <hi>Arca Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Phanicia</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> being the Son of <hi>Varius Marcellus</hi> by <hi>Mammaea,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Semiamira,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus,</hi> received the Empire to the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Comfort of Mankind. He had ſome years before been Created <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the Senate, at the time of the death of <hi>Opilius Macrinus;</hi> and now the Senate both made him Emperor, and<note place="margin">Honours done to him.</note> gave him the Title of the Father of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and inveſted him with the Tribunitian and Proconſular Powers; and with the right of a fifth Reference, all in one and the ſame day. And for fear that ſuch an accumulation of Honours ſhould ſeem to be Precipitate, I will here in the firſt place mention the Reaſon, as well why he ſuffered it on his part, as why the Senate had thought fit to do it on theirs; becauſe certainly otherwiſe, it was neither for the Gravity of the Senate to confer all thoſe things at once; nor for the Reputation of a good Prince ſo to accept them. The Army had ſeveral times been guilty of a Practice of making whom they pleaſed Emperors in a hurry, and changing them as eaſily, when they had done; ſaying, in the defence of themſelves, that they did not know that the Senate had on their part nominated any Perſon at all to the Empire. For thus they had ſet up <hi>Peſcennius Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Clodius Albinus,</hi> and <hi>Avidius Caſſius;</hi> as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they did <hi>Julius Vindex,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. Severus</hi> was himſelf ſet up by them, in one place, about the ſame time that <hi>Niger</hi> was in
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:52508:202"/> another, and <hi>Albinus</hi> in another; and yet then the Senate had actually appointed <hi>Didius Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> to ſucceed after <hi>Pertinax.</hi> And this thing had occaſioned Civil-Wars in the Empire; in which Countrymen againſt Countrymen fighting, what were they but Murderers one of another? Upon this account therefore it was that all expedition was uſed to inveſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Severus</hi> with all the Honours of the Crown immediately, and at once, which he ſhould otherwiſe have received ſucceſſively and in the courſe of many years. And this was yet further promoted, by the very great inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which both the Senate and the People had towards him, after that Peſt, who had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſhonoured the name of the <hi>Antoninuſſes,</hi> but was a ſhame to all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. So all the marks of Power, and the Titles of Honour, belonging to the Crown, were given him with a forwardneſs, in which every one appeared to have an Emulation to excel. He was the firſt of all the Emperors that ever received ſo many Royalties all at one time: and indeed his Quality, as he had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for ſome years a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſpoke for him; but yet the honeſty of his Life and Manners did it much more; and it had gained him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great eſteem, that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to kill him, but could not, becauſe of the Oppoſition to it of the Soldiers and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And then that which Crowns all, is; he approved himſelf worthy of that Care that the Senate had taken of his Preſervation, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Affections of the Soldiers, and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:52508:203"/> worthy of the Sentiments all good Men had to prefer him, as they did, to the Empire.</p>
                     <p>His Mother being called <hi>Mammaea,</hi> as I ſaid, he is mentioned by a great many by the name of <hi>Alexander Mammaeus,</hi> from her. This <hi>Alexander</hi> from a Child, was ſo inſtructed in<note place="margin">His Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Maſters.</note> the knowledge of the good Arts concerning the things, as well Civil as Military, that he willingly ſuffered not one day to paſs, in which he did not exerciſe himſelf in the one or the other. His firſt Maſters, in his Infancy, for the Elements, were <hi>Valerius Cordus, Titus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turius,</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Philippus,</hi> a Servant of his Fathers, who hath ſince writ his life. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the Grammar, was <hi>Neon;</hi> in Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, <hi>Serapion;</hi> and in Philoſophy, <hi>Stylion:</hi> that is, this was in his own Country, and for the <hi>Graecian</hi> Learning. At <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Latin, his Maſter in the Grammar was <hi>Scau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi> the Son of the famous Doctor of that name; in Rhetorick, <hi>Julius Frontinus, Baebius Macrinus,</hi> and <hi>Julius Granianus;</hi> of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which, there are Declamations now extant. But in the <hi>Latin</hi> Learning, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency was not over-great; as it ſufficiently appears by his Speeches which he made to the Senate; and thoſe others that he made to the Soldiers and to the People. Nor did he very much love the Latin Eloquence. But the learned Men in it, he had a great eſteem for, and apprehended thir Pens; for he was not willing that they ſhould give him an ill report in their Writings; therefore he thought them worthy to be <hi>By</hi> him upon all occaſions; and
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:52508:203"/> with every thing that he did, publickly or privately, if they had not been preſent at it, he acquainted them himſelf, and deſired them to be informed carefully of the truth of all things, and accordingly to repreſent them to the World.</p>
                     <p>He renounced the Title of <hi>Dominus,</hi> that<note place="margin">His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> is Lord; and ordered that they ſhould write Letters to him, as to a private Perſon, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only the name of Emperor. He refuſed the Jewels, to his Shooes and his Cloaths, which had been worn by <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi> He went in a White Veſtment, as he is commonly Drawn; and plain, not Embroidered nor Fringed with Gold; and of the Common Stuffs. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf ſo frankly with his Friends, that he often obliged them to ſit down by him; and went to their Houſes to their Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without Ceremony; and received them again continually to his own Table without a formal Invitation. He was to be waited upon, with as eaſie Acceſs as a Senator: whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſome other Reigns, a Prince would not ſuffer himſelf. to be ſeen. He was Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</note> as to his Perſon, and well made, as we ſee him at this day in his Pictures and Statues. He had a Cavalier Meen and Stature, his Strength anſwerable; and he both knew his Vigour, and took care to preſerve it. Some called him the <hi>Pious Alexander,</hi> he was ſo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, at leaſt as a good and uſeful Prince, all the Earth eſteemed him. He drew a Lot at the Temple of <hi>Fortune,</hi> at the City of <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> in
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:52508:204"/> the time that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> waited for his Life, out of <hi>Virgil;</hi> which was this, <hi>Aen.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>—<hi>Siqua fata aſpera rumpas,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Tu Marcellus eris.</hi>—</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Which was as much as to ſignifie; <hi>That if he but eſcaped the preſent Danger, that he was in, he would be a glorious Emperor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The occaſion of his Name of <hi>Alexander</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Occaſion of his Name.</note> was from hence. In his Native City of <hi>Arca Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> there was a Temple Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> whither upon the Feſtival of that Prince, according to the Cuſtom of the Country, his Father, and <hi>Mammaea</hi> his Mother, went to aſſiſt at the uſual Solemnities. But by accident his Mother fell into Labour, and was delivered of him in this Temple; ſo ſhe called him <hi>Alexander:</hi> and the day of the Birth of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Mammaea,</hi> is the ſame with the day of the Death of <hi>Alexander the Great.</hi> The Senate offered him, the name of <hi>Antoninus.</hi> But he refuſed it; although he had an Affinity, as well as <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Antoninus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racallus;</hi> and an Affinity, which was ſo much better than his, as it was without the ſtain of his Baſtardiſe: For the Emperor <hi>Septimius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> had Married a Noble Lady out of the Eaſt, whoſe Horoſcope, as he had heard it was; <hi>That, ſhe ſhould be the Wife of a Prince;</hi> though he was then but in a private Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which Lady's Siſter's Daughters, were one of them the Mother of this <hi>Alexander,</hi> and
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:52508:204"/> the other the Mother of <hi>Varius Heliogabalus.</hi> So the two Sons were truely Couſin-<hi>Germans</hi> to one another, and equal upon that Foot in their Relation to <hi>Antoninus Caracallus.</hi> But it was not only the name of <hi>Antoninus</hi> which he refuſed; but the Senate by a Decree preſented him the Title of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> and he refuſed that alſo.</p>
                     <p>Now it will not be amiſs here to ſubjoyn his Speech to the Senate, in which he excuſes his Acceptation of the one and the other Name. Only in the firſt place I will report the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate's Acclamations upon this occaſion, out of the Records of the City, as I find them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Day, but one, before the <hi>Nones</hi> of <hi>March;</hi> when the Senate being aſſembled in the Temple of <hi>Concord,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> at their repeated requeſt diſpenſing at laſt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to repair to them, though he knew that their Buſineſs was to treat of the Honours which they deſigned to give him, they cried as he entred thus;</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>After theſe Accclamations, the Emperor took the Liberty to ſpeak thus to them.</p>
                     <p>Fathers of the Senate,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THis is not the firſt of my Obligations to you. I am to thank you for the Honour of my Name of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which you gave me ſo long ſince, and for my Life which you alſo have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. I thank you, as for the Empire, ſo for the Style of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which you now give me; and for the Pontifical, the Tribunitian, and the Proconſular Powers; all which by altogether a new Example, you have liberally conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me in one day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Senate reply'd, and cry'd;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As your Majeſty hath accepted theſe things, ſo accept the Name of <hi>Antoninus.</hi> Let not the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, let not the Princes the <hi>Antoninuſſes</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to receive this favour of your Majeſty.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperor reſumed his Diſcourſe, and ſaid;</p>

                     <p> 
                        <hi>
                           <hi>Fathers of the Senate,</hi> I earneſtly deſire you not to engage me to be called to the neceſſity of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying ſo great a Name as that is, when my Own, which I have from my Birth, and which is but a Foreign one, I find is too Burdenſome to me. For ſo it is with theſe Great Names, they are Burdens; and not to anſwer them, it is as ill as if the Name of <hi>Cicero</hi> ſhould be born by a Mute, or the Name of <hi>Varro,</hi> by a Blockhead, or that of the Pious <hi>Metellus</hi> by a Villain. And that the Gods may avert ſo ill an Omen, who is there that can be pleaſed to ſee, that a Name from whence great Actions are expected, is not ſuſtained in its Grandeur, by him that bears it; if he is in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo to do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Senate interrupted him, with the like Acclamations as before; and then he went on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You know, Gentlemen, to what a heighth of Glory, or rather to what a Divinity the Name of <hi>Antoninus</hi> hath been carried in the Perſons of four Princes; whoſe Piety, whoſe Learning, whoſe Innocence, and whoſe Fortitude, if we conſider them ſeverally; What could be more Religious than <hi>Antoninus Pius?</hi> What more knowing than <hi>Marcus Antoninus?</hi> What more ſincere than <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Antoninus?</hi> And what more Brave and Valorous than <hi>Antoninus Caracallus?</hi> I am not willing to mention <hi>Commodus Antoninus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion to you; except it is to ſay that he was ſo much the worſe, becauſe with that ill life of his, he yet continued in the uſe of the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:52508:206"/> Name of <hi>Antoninus. Antoninus Diadumenus,</hi> had not time, nor Age to ſhew himſelf: an Art of his Father, had put that Name upon him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Senate broke out into the like Acclamations as before: and then he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But eſpecially you may eaſily remember, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, How things lately went, when the Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not only of all Men, but Brutes, took it upon him to bear the Name of <hi>Antoninus;</hi> who at the ſame time in Impurity and Luxury outdid <hi>Nero, Vitellius, Commodus,</hi> and all their wicked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates. You remember, what Sighs paſſed at that time, in all Companies of the People and the Gentry: and how they all cryed with one Voice, that this Wretch is not fit to be at all called an <hi>Antoninus.</hi> This Peſt violates that Holy Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Senate replyed in theſe Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Gods Protect us from all the like evils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. We fear them not under your Reign. We are ſecure under the Government of your Majeſty. Your Majeſty is above all Vice. Your Majeſty hath ſurmounted, hath vanquiſhed the Temptation of all ſuch Crimes and Diſgraces. You are an Honour to the Name of <hi>Antoninus.</hi> We are certain of this; we are well perſuaded of it; we preſume upon it, without the fear of ever repenting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: we have approved you from your Youth, and this day, we are confirmed in our Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

                     <p>The Emperor replied again and ſaid,</p>

                        <hi>It is not, Fathers of the Senate, that I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi>

But it is in Truth, becauſe in the firſt place, I do not delight to aſſume what is the Name of a ſtrange Family; and next, becauſe I ſee very well, that it is to impoſe too great a burden upon me.</hi>

                        <hi>For with as much reaſon as I ſhould take the Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> I might take that of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> too: I might as well take that of <hi>Titus:</hi> I might as well take that of <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Senate anſwered him to this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Your Majeſty is an <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and accepts that Name; ſo be you alſo an <hi>Antoninus.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperor ſaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſee very well, now, Fathers of the Senate, what it is that moves you to preſs this Name upon us. You think, that we may as well be called <hi>Antonini,</hi> although it is the Name of another's Family, as all we who ſucceed to the Empire are entitled in our Stiles <hi>Auguſti:</hi> which we are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have an hereditary Right to be ſo, as
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:52508:207"/> being as it were by Adoption, the Sons of the firſt <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who was the Founder of the Empire. The <hi>Antoninuſſes</hi> themſelves were called <hi>Auguſti.</hi> Now <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> adopted <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> to be his Sons and Succeſſors. This Adoption made it a Right to them, to take his Name, which became alſo hereditary to <hi>Commodus,</hi> by reaſon that he was the Son of <hi>Marcus;</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Right, it was a Trick of his Father, which put the Name upon <hi>Diadumenus.</hi> It was affected in the Perſon of <hi>Caracallus,</hi> and it was profaned to the laſt degree by <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Senate cried,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Gods ſave the Emperor <hi>Alexander,</hi> our <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> We congratulate your Modeſty, your Prudence, your Innocence, your Integrity. This ſhews us what will be the excellency of your Reign. We are raviſh'd at it. Your Majeſty will direct the Senate hereafter to make a Choice of the beſt Princes. Your Majeſty will juſtifie the Judgments of the Senate. The Gods ſave <hi>Alexander,</hi> our <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Let <hi>Alexander</hi> our <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Temples, of the <hi>Antoninuſſes.</hi> Our <hi>Caeſar,</hi> our <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> our <hi>Emperor,</hi> the Gods ſave you. Conquer, Proſper, and Reign many Years.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperor reſumed himſelf again, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I underſtand then, I have obtained from you, Fathers of the Senate, what I deſired. I take this very obligingly, and I give you, and owe
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:52508:208"/> you infinite Thanks. It ſhall be my endeavour, that my own Name, which I bring with me, the firſt of any upon the Throne of <hi>Rome,</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch as not to be unworthy to be coveted by others after me, and to be recommended by the good Opinions of this moſt Pious Senate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Senate cried,</p>
                     <p>Alexander <hi>the</hi> Great, <hi>the Gods ſave you. Tho' your Majeſty refuſed the Name of</hi> Antoninus, <hi>receive the Title of the</hi> Great. <hi>The Gods ſave</hi> Alexander <hi>the</hi> Great. They repeated this often.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor ſaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You have offered to me, Gentlemen, in this, a<note place="margin">and the Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Great.</hi>
                           </note> thing of a greater difficulty to do, than it was to aſſume the Name of <hi>Antoninus;</hi> to which if I had conſented, it might have been attributed to either my Affinity to the Princes of that Name, or to a mutual Love of the ſame Name, upon the ſame Throne. But why me, to take your Title of <hi>Great?</hi> What have I yet done, that is ſo? If <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> were ſo called, yet it was after the great Exploits of the one, and the great Triumphs of the other. Therefore ſpeak no more of this, my honoured Fathers, and rather than ſuggeſt to me the Title of the <hi>Great,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me to be one of yourſelves, and you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are a magnificent Aſſembly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, they repeated the Acclamation, <hi>The Gods ſave</hi> Aurelius Alexander <hi>our Auguſtus,</hi> and ſo ended this matter.</p>

                     <p>There were ſeveral other things done in the Senate, that day. But when the Houſe had riſen, the Emperor returned as it were in Triumph home, with much more Honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by refuſing, than if he had accepted of thoſe ſuppoſed Names. His Firmneſs to himſelf in it, and the entire Gravity of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour gave him a Reputation, which every body was ſenſible of, to obſerve, that the whole Senate together was not able to over-perſuade one young Man. He diſcovered the ſame Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of mind in his Affairs with the Soldiers, and a wonderful and ſingular Conſtancy in correcting their Inſolencies; ſo that although he could not be perſuaded by all the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Senate, to receive either the Name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> or of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> yet<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Why call'd</hi> Severus.</note> the Soldiers fixed upon him that of <hi>Alexander Severus;</hi> and this not only conciliated him a great Reſpect in his own time, but it will much redound to his Glory to all Poſterity; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that it is derived purely from his own Boſom, and it is what his intrinſick Merit and Courage, directed them to give him. He did not ſtick indeed to caſhier whole Legions at a time, for daring to mutiny; nor to animadvert very ſeverely upon the Soldiers, that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any thing which but ſeemed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, wherein he exceeded the Exactneſs and Boldneſs of all the Princes his predeceſſors, ſince the formation of the Empire under <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There were ſome Omens which from his Birth had preſignified his future Reign, which
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:52508:209"/> were theſe. Firſt, the day of his Birth was the<note place="margin">Omens of his future Reign.</note> ſame with the day of the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> in whoſe Temple his Mother was delivered of him, and whoſe Name he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took from thence. Then the ſame day that he was born, a Pigeon's Egg of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Purple, was taken, and by a good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man preſented to his Mother; from whence the Soothſayers ſaid, <hi>That he would one day, and it would be quickly too, be an Emperor, but not that he would reign long.</hi> In the mean time, whilſt his Mother was delivered of him in the Temple, a Picture of the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> which was hanging over the head of her Bed at home, fell down into the Bed. His Nurſe was of the Name of <hi>Olympias;</hi> and the Mother of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> was of the ſame. His Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Father was a Country-man, of the Name of <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> was the ſame. Upon the day that he was born, they ſay, there appeared a Star of the firſt magnitude in the Heavens, all the day long over the City of <hi>Arca Caeſarea;</hi> and the Sun was crowned with a bright Circle about it, whilſt it pointed upon his Father's Houſe. A Laurel in his Father's Garden which was ſet by the ſide of a Peach, in one year had over-topped the Peach. The Peach being <hi>malum Perſicum;</hi> this, thoſe who pretended to Augury, ſaid, was an Omen that he ſhould one day Conquer the <hi>Perſians.</hi> The Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Mother was delivered of him, ſhe dreamt ſhe ſhould be brought to Bed of a little purple-coloured Dragon; and his Father had
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:52508:209"/> dreamt at the ſame time that he was carried up to the Heavens upon the Wings of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Victory,</hi> which is in the Houſe of the Senate at <hi>Rome.</hi> He conſulted, when he was a Youth, with a Soothſayer about his Fortune in the way of drawing Lots. The firſt Lot which he drew ſaid, <hi>That the Empire of the Heavens, the Earth, and the Sea, awaited him;</hi> by which it was eaſie to underſtand, that he ſhould one day be Deified. The ſecond ſaid, <hi>That the Empire paramount, awaited him;</hi> which was plainly no other, than the Empire of <hi>Rome.</hi> Another Lot that he drew, was theſe Verſes of <hi>Virgil,</hi> Aen. 6.</p>

                     <p>That is, <hi>That his Arts ſhould be Government, and the giving of Laws of War and Peace; and that he ſhould be the Miniſter of Mercy and Juſtice to the People.</hi> There were ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſigns of his future Grandeur beſides all theſe. He had a Fire and a Vivacity in his Eyes extraordinary. He looked one down with it, you could not hold your Eyes againſt his long. His Mind diſcovered a Power of Divination in it very frequently, ſo that he ſpoke of things to come, as really they did. He had a Memory ſo happy, that none but <hi>Acholius,</hi> hath ſaid, that he was once prompted or aſſiſted in any thing.</p>
                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:52508:210"/>
                     <p>Coming very young to the Empire, he acted altogether in all things with the Advice of his Mother, as if ſhe had reigned in Conjunction with him. And indeed ſhew was a good and pious Lady, but covetous, and loved to amaſs Money to a fault. He began his Reign with a general purgation of all the Magiſtrates and Officers of the promotion of the impure <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus;</hi> being Perſons whom that Prince had preferred to the greateſt Dignities out of the very Lees of Mankind. He clear'd the State of them. He purged the Senate and the Order of the<note place="margin">Reforms the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> Gentry of them. He purged the Tribes of the City. He turned out all obſcene and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Perſons from all Places in the Court, in which laſt, he made ſuch a Reform, that retain'd not a Mouth, but what was neceſſary. Becauſe <hi>an Emperor,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>was an ill Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the People; who out of their Bowels feeds a Company of unneceſſary Mouths, that are uſeleſs to the State.</hi> He looked carefully after the Magazines of Proviſions, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration thereof to the Soldiers; out of whoſe allowances, if the Tribunes had made any unlawful Gain to themſelves, he puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with Death. As for Cauſes and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Law, he ordered them firſt to be well conſidered in all their Circumſtances by his Miniſters, and his Council Learned in the Law, whereof <hi>Ulpian</hi> was the Chief; and when they had done, he directed them to make a Report of their Judgments to him.</p>
                     <p>He moderated an infinite number of Laws concerning the Rights of the People, and thoſe
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:52508:210"/> of the Exchequer. In which caſes he always communicated them with twenty great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, beſides others who were wiſe and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Men, to the number of no leſs than fifty generally; ſo that there were as many Votes to a Conſtitution of his, as to an Act of the Senate. Theſe Perſons ſpoke admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well in his Councils; every one's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage was asked, which they writ down one after another; time being allowed them firſt to examine things very well, and to weigh what they had to ſay, becauſe no one ſhould complain that he had been obliged to give his Judgment upon ſuch Matters of Importance, without a due premeditation. Then he had this Cuſtom, that if it was a thing of Right to be tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>ted upon, he called only the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the Eloquent Doctors to ſpeak to it. But if it was a Military Affair, he ſent for the old Officers and Soldiers, Men skilled in War and Encampments, and the Situation of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and together with thoſe he particularly adviſed with ſuch as underſtood that Hiſtory; of whom he enquired, what had at any time been done in the like rencounters, by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Emperors, or other great Captains, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at home or abroad. If at any time he happened to ſee a Man who lay under the Character of having robbed the Province un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Government, he was ready with his Fingers as it were (ſays <hi>Encolpius,</hi> who was one that was very familiar with him) to pull out his Eyes, he had ſuch a hatred to that baſeneſs. To which <hi>Septimius</hi> adds, that altho'
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:52508:211"/> they had not been as yet convicted, yet he had ſuch an averſion to them, for the Scandal only, that if he ſaw them by any ſudden Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, the Commotion he was in, would ſet him vomiting, and all his Face on a Fire, and he would not be able to ſpeak for ſome time. And certainly, as one called <hi>Septimius Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who had been tried for this, but acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Reign of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> came one day in Company with ſome of the Senators to ſalute him, he no ſooner ſaw him, but he cried; <hi>O ye ſupreme Powers! O</hi> Jupiter! <hi>O ye immortal Gods! Is</hi> Arabinus <hi>alive, and a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? It may be, he hopes for the ſame favour from me, that he had from</hi> Heliogabalus. <hi>But I am ſorry he takes me to be ſuch a Fool.</hi>

If any one had pretended to do, or ſay any thing that was ſweeter than the Cuſtom was to be, he was ſent away as a Flatterer, if the place permitted it; or he was laught at ſufficiently in caſe that his Condition did not make him ſubject to a greater Affront. He ordered to all the Senators, as they had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him, Chairs to ſit down. But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to admit none to pay their Reverences to him in this kind, but Perſons of Honeſty and good Repute; forbidding all ſuch as knew themſelves to be otherwiſe, by the common Crier, to come near him; for if he once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them, it ſhould coſt them their Lives. He refuſed to be adored as <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was, after the manner of the Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:52508:211"/> moſt corrupt Magiſtrates, he ſaid, always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the moſt of Poverty, thinking by that means to conceal the Crimes of their Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries and ill Lives. This he ſaid often, and it was his real Sentiment. To which he added a known Obſervation upon this Subject, <hi>That he who takes away a great deal, and gives but a little to Vouchers to ſpeak for him, will how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever always be ſafe.</hi>

                     <p>He was a Prince of that great Temper, that<note place="margin">His excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> he never ſuffered his Servants to part with him when once they were placed. He was ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and ſo gracious to every body, that he viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when ſick, his Friends, of whatever Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were. He deſired every one to ſpeak their Sentiments freely to him, and he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to what they ſaid patiently; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered things according to their Advices, as much as in Juſtice it was poſſible. And if any thing by them had not been done ſo well as it ought, he convinced them of it, but it was without haughtineſs and without bitterneſs. He obliged them all to ſit down upon Chairs by him, and informed himſelf always about the abſent. In fine, his Mother <hi>Mammaea,</hi> and <hi>Memmia</hi> his Wife, who was the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> of the Conſular Order, and the Grand-Daughter of <hi>Catulus,</hi> objected to him his too great Civility, and told him, <hi>It weakned his Sovereign Power, and rendred it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable;</hi> to which he anſwered, <hi>That on the contrary it was the way to live long, and with ſafety.</hi> He paſſed no day without doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was ſweet, obliging and pious; but yet with that meaſure, as not to exhauſt the publick Coffers. Rarely any Eſtates were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated into the Exchequer in his Time. He remitted the Tribute to ſeveral Cities, towards their publick Buildings. He lent Money out of the Exchequer at four in the hundred. And to a great many poor, he lent them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Money without uſe, to purchaſe themſelves Grounds, under the condition of paying the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:52508:212"/> Debt only in the Product. He added to his Captains of the Guards the Senatorial Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,<note place="margin">His Care of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery.</note> which had ſeldom or never at all been done before in other times; becauſe it was inconſiſtent then, to be a Captain of the Guards, and a Senator, as <hi>Marius Maximus</hi> hath often obſerved. But <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> was willing that his Captains of the Guards ſhould be Senators for this reaſon, becauſe no body ſhould have the Power to judge a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but who was himſelf a Senator. He had the Muſter-Rolls of his Armies in all Parts, always in his Cabinet by him; and when he was alone, he was reviewing their Accounts, Numbers, Actions, Officers, Stations, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; ſo that where-ever they were, he had a perfect knowledge of them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion, he mentioned a great many of their Names. He kept a Regiſter of all ſuch as merited to be conſidered for their Services. He refreſhed his Memory of things, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his own Memoirs, in which he ſet down the dates, and who, and what every one was, and upon whoſe recommendation promoted. He aſſiſted the Convoys of the annual Proviſion of Corn for the People of <hi>Rome</hi> in that manner; that whereas <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus</hi> had diſſipated the Stores which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſed in the Granaries, he re-eſtabliſhed them again at his proper Charge and Expence.</p>
                     <p>He encouraged the Merchants to come to <hi>Rome</hi> to Traffick, by allowing to them great Immunities. The quantity of the Oyl, which the Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> had gained to the City,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:52508:213"/> but which <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had diminiſhed, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Stores into the hands of Men, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with all ſorts of Vice, he intirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed. He ſet up a great many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Works at <hi>Rome.</hi> He tolerated the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He deferred ſo much to the Chief Prieſts, and to the <hi>Quindecimviri,</hi> and the Augurs, in Sacred Things, that after ſome Cauſes of that kind had been heard and determined by himſelf, he hath ſuffered thoſe Perſons to re-examin them, and to decide them otherwiſe. Such of the Preſidents of the Provinces, as he found that he ſhould truly eſteem, being Men of Integrity and Honour, and whoſe Praiſes, were not directed by a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faction, he always took in the Coach with him abroad, and made them Rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, ſaying, <hi>That as much as others who are corrupt in their Governments ought to be turned out and beggered; theſe deſerve to be purchaſed and inriched.</hi> The People of <hi>Rome</hi> petitioning him to lower the Prices of Proviſions, when they were one time at an exceſſive heighth; he asked what ſort of Proviſions particularly they were, that they thought too dear. They anſwered, Beef and Pork. Now he did not think fit to fix a cheaper Price upon them immediately, according to the Letter of their deſire; but inſtead of that, he ordered, that no body ſhould kill a Sow, Pig, Cow or Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, under ſuch an Age prefixt: And by this means, that which before was eight Pence a Pound, was at length brought down to two Pence.</p>
                     <pb n="415" facs="tcp:52508:213"/>
                     <p>He hearkened to the Complaints of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers againſt their Tribunes, in that manner, that if he found the Tribunes in a Crime, he puniſhed them according to the Quality of it, without Favour. He made enquiry about all ſorts of Perſons by his ſecret ſervice Men, whom he continually employed, to others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. He kept his Slaves always in the Cloaths of Slaves, his infranchiſed Men in the Habits of Free men. He ſuffer'd no Eunuchs<note place="margin">He ſlights the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.</note> to be in any Places about himſelf, but left them to ſerve his Wife in the quality of her Slaves. He reduced them to a certain Number, and ſuffered them to have to do with nothing in the Court, but the Baths of the Ladies; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who was the Slave of theſe Slaves, had preferred many of them to great Offices. He took from them even their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Privileges; ſaying, <hi>They were a third Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of humane kind that ought not to be ſeen or imployed amongſt Men, and ſcarcely neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Women of Honour.</hi> One of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly who had pretended to have an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him, and had received of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a hundred pieces of Gold to aſſiſt him in ſomething, he crucified for an Example up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the High-way.</p>
                     <p>He changed ſeveral Praetorian Provinces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of Praeſidial Provinces, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed of the Proconſular Provinces according to the will of the Senate. He forbad the uſe of mixt Baths at <hi>Rome</hi> of both Sexes together, as they had been forbidden formerly under the Reigns of other pious Princes, till only <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus</hi>
                        <pb n="416" facs="tcp:52508:214"/> had revived them. He ſuffered not the Tax upon the Pimps, Whores, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſhes to be returned into his own Coffers, but he aſſigned it towards the Reparation of the Theatre, the Cirque, and the Amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre. He had ſometime had the Thoughts of making a Law againſt the Burdaſhes, as the Emperor <hi>Philip</hi> afterwards did. But he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that it would only occaſion more lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to be coveted in private, becauſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind run with a greater guſt upon ſome things when they are denied them; and the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition encreaſes the deſire to obtain. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a Tax upon the <hi>Drapers, Glaſs-makers, Tanners, Lockſmiths, Silverſmiths, Goldſmiths,</hi> and ſeveral other Crafts, out of which he ordered the Baths to be fitted and maintained for the publick uſe of the People. He furniſhed the ſame Baths with Wood and Oyl, for the Lamps in the Night, whereas before they were not uſed to be opened till Nine in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at Sun-ſet were ſhut up again.</p>
                     <p>It is not altogether true, what ſome Perſons have writ, that his Reign was without Blood. For as the Soldiers had given him the Name of <hi>Severus;</hi> he made it appear in the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that he exacted, that he had not that Name for nothing. He repaired the Works of<note place="margin">His pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Works.</note> the antient Emperors, and added many new ones to them of his own. Amongſt which are the Baths of his Name, hard by thoſe of <hi>Nero,</hi> which are ſupplied by an Aqueduct that carries alſo his Name at this day. He added thereunto a Plantation of a Grove, in the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:52508:214"/> place of a private Houſe adjoyning, which he bought, and afterwards expreſly pulled it down for this purpoſe. He finiſhed the Galleries to the Baths of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> and adorned that whole Work. He firſt brought up the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Work of Building and Paving with two ſorts of Marble together, the <hi>Porphyry</hi> and the <hi>Lacedaemonian;</hi> with which he adorned the Court. He ſet up ſeveral Coloſſuſſes in the City, faſhioned by the hand of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Artiſts that he could procure from all Parts. He made a great many Medals with impreſſes of his Portraiture, ſome of fine Braſs, but the moſt of Gold. He forbad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of an ill Repute, of what Quality ſoever, to come to viſit his Mother or his Wife. He made many Harangues to the People, in places about the City, as heretofore the Tribunes and the antient Conſuls did. He thrice gave the People a Largeſs, and thrice the Soldiers a Bounty; and to the Bread and the Corn which he gave to the People in their Largeſſes, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Portions of Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>He brought down the Uſe of Money to four<note place="margin">He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Intereſt of Money.</note> in the hundred, at the hands of the Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, and the Uſurers themſelves. As for the Senators in this caſe, he firſt of all had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that no Senators ſhould take Uſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was ſome Preſent in the way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, for having aſſiſted a poor Friend in his Neceſſity. But afterwards he allowed them to take a moiety of the Uſe, which was paid to the Uſurers; but then nothing in the way of a Preſent at all. He tranſlated the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:52508:215"/> Statues of the great Men from all parts of the City, into the <hi>Forum</hi> of <hi>Trajan. Paulus</hi> and <hi>Ulpian</hi> were in ſingular eſteem with him, and the Captains of his Guards; the latter had been always his Counſellor, and both of them Aſſeſſors to <hi>Papinian.</hi> He had built a Royal<note place="margin">Other of hsi pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Works.</note> Structure of his Name, betwixt the Field of <hi>Mars</hi> and the Bars of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> being one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot in breadth, and one thouſand in length, and ſupported all by Columns; but however, he could not perfect it, becauſe he was prevented by his Death. He beautified extremely the Temples of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Serapis,</hi> furniſhing them with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Veſſels of the Marble of <hi>Delos,</hi> and with all the things belonging to the myſtical Ceremonies of that Worſhip. He was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affectionate and pious towards his Mother <hi>Mammaea;</hi> inſomuch, that he gave her Name to ſome Buildings which he added to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at <hi>Rome;</hi> as alſo to a Royal Manſion, and to a Pond which he made at <hi>Baiae,</hi> where they do ſtill retain it at this day. In the ſame place he built other magnificent Structures, and made Ponds of a prodigious greatneſs (by letting in the Sea, when he pleaſed) in honour of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relations. The Bridges of <hi>Trajan</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired almoſt in all places where they were; ſome he built New himſelf, but for thoſe that he had repaired, he ſtill continued upon them the Name of <hi>Trajan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was ſometime thinking to appoint unto every degree of Men, from Slaves to the higheſt Magiſtrates and Officers of all ſorts, a particular
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:52508:215"/> Habit, whereby they ſhould be diſtinguiſh'd; which he ſaid, would be a Bridle, eſpecially upon all the Slaves, and would keep them alſo from mixing and confounding themſelves with the Free-People; but <hi>Ulpian</hi> and <hi>Paulus</hi> did not approve of this, becauſe, they ſaid, it would be an occaſion of a great deal of Miſchief, ſhould Men be eaſily diſpoſed to quarrel. So then he judged it was enough, that the Order of the Gentry ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from that of the Senators or Nobility, by the quality of their Gowns; the latter having their Gowns purled with Knaps or Studs of purple of a larger ſize, and the others with leſs. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Senators to wear within the City, againſt the Cold and the Rain, the <hi>Paenula,</hi> that is, a Hanging Coat, which otherwiſe is a Veſtment only proper for the Road; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he forbad the Dames to uſe the like ſort of Wear, that is, Mantles within the City; but upon the Road, they might do, as they pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>He had a greater Command of the Eloquence<note place="margin">His At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in Arts.</note> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, than of the Latin; and he made no bad Verſe. He loved Muſick, and was skill'd in the knowledge of Aſtrology, which was taught and publickly profeſſed at <hi>Rome</hi> by his Command. He was alſo very well verſed in the Science of the Soothſayers, both as to the Entrails of the Sacrifices, and as to the Flights and Notes of Birds; inſomuch, that he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did in theſe, the <hi>Biſcayners</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Augurs</hi> of <hi>Pannonia.</hi> He was a Geometrician; he painted admirably, he ſung very well; but yet never but in the hearing of his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:52508:216"/> He writ the Lives of the good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his predeceſſors in Verſe; he played well upon the Harp, Flute, and Organ; he ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded well upon the Trumpet, only he did not make this to appear after he was Emperor. He was the beſt at the Exerciſes of the Body of any of his time; thoſe of Arms he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed perfectly well; and how great a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he was, his Wars leave us no room to doubt, in which he acquitted himſelf ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, and reaped ſo much Glory. He was only Thrice pleaſed to accept the Conſulate, and then he always ſubſtituted others to his place with the firſt opportunity. He was a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judge againſt Thieves and Robbers; with, all the rigour imaginable, he condemned them, and ſaid, <hi>That they were ordinarily the occaſion of all the Crimes that were daily committed, and that they were the only Plagues and Enemies of the State.</hi> A certain Clerk once having given in a falſe breviate to the Council, he ordered him to be cut into the Sinews of his Fingers, ſo, as never to be able to write again, and then to be baniſhed for ever. He ſet up Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſuſſes, and Statues, ſome on foot, and ſome on Horſeback, to the honour of the deified Emperors in the <hi>Forum</hi> of <hi>Nerva,</hi> with Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions upon Columns of Braſs containing all their memorable Actions, after the Example of the Marble Statues of the great Men, and the Elogiums of their Lives, which <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> ſet up in the <hi>Forum</hi> that bears his Name. He deſired to appear to derive the Origine of his Blood from the <hi>Romans;</hi> for he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:52508:216"/> to be called a <hi>Syrian;</hi> and was much affronted by that Name, by the People of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> when once they called him, not only a <hi>Syrian,</hi> but a High-Prieſt, and a Ruler of the Synagogue, as if he was a <hi>Jew</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>Before I give an account of his Arms and his Military Expeditions, I will here premiſe a few things touching his particular Life, and his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Affairs. He had in his private Oratory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Court; that is, there were indeed two Oratories there which he uſed, but this was the<note place="margin">His dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment.</note> chief, and the holieſt, the Images of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deified Emperors of the beſt Note, and the greateſt Virtue, together with which he had the Images of other pious Souls, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected as Gods; and amongſt the reſt, <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius Thyanaeus;</hi> and as a Writer of thoſe times alſo ſays, <hi>CHRIST, Abraham, Orpheus,</hi> and ſuch others, as likewiſe the Images of his own Anceſtors. Hither therefore in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early, if he had the leiſure, he came to perform his Devotions. But elſe, if he did not do this, he either took the Air in his Coach, or went a Fiſhing, or Hunting, or Walking, according to the quality of the place. After this, if he had time, he beſtowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a good hour, to the care of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, which indeed required ſo much the leſs of his attention, as both the Military and the Civil Affairs were treated amongſt his Councellors, who were Men Holy and Faithful, and were never to be corrupted for Money; ſo that their Reſolutions finally paſſed,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:52508:217"/> unleſs he had offered ſomething himſelf that was New. But yet if neceſſity ſo required, he was ſet down to Buſineſs in a morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was day, and continued in it many hours, and never thought the time tedious, nor retired either more to appearance, pleaſed or diſpleaſed, than he came; his Countenance being always equal, and being of a Soul equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contented with every thing that paſſed. He was certainly one of a great Prudence, which was not to be impoſed upon in any thing; for though it were attempted with never ſo good a Grace, he diſcovered it, and obliged the Author to repent of his Labour.</p>
                     <p>After his application to the publick Buſineſs, whatever it was, Military or Civil, he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt part of his leiſure to Reading. He read the <hi>Greek</hi> Books, and amongſt the<note place="margin">His addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Learning.</note> reſt, particularly thoſe of the Commonwealth of <hi>Plato.</hi> When he read in <hi>Latin,</hi> he delighted in nothing more, than the <hi>Offices of</hi> Cicero, and his Books upon the ſame Subject of a Commonwealth. Sometimes he read the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators and the Poets, and amongſt others par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>Serenus Sammonicus,</hi> who was one that he had perſonally known, and had much loved. He was much pleaſed with the Verſe of <hi>Horace.</hi> He read very much alſo the Life of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> whom he endeavoured to imitate; but in whom, he condemned his Drinking, and his Cruelty towards his Friends; if yet thoſe Imputations upon him are true, becauſe there are good Authors that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, as to the one and the other, to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:52508:217"/> whom this Prince gave a great Credit. After Reading, he moderately employed himſelf in Exerciſes of the Body, as Wreſtling, Tennis,<note place="margin">His bodily Exerciſes.</note> Running, or Fencing. Then he was anointed, and afterwards put himſelf into the Bath, which was ſeldom or never a Bath of warm Water, but of the natural Waters of cold Baths, where he continued about an hour, Faſting, he drank about a Pint and a half of cold Spring-Water. Then when he had done with the Bath, he took a Breakfaſt upon Bread and Milk, and Eggs and Wine. After this, when the hour of Dinner was come, he dined. Sometimes he deferred to eat till Supper, but for the moſt part he dined. And he was often ſerved with the <hi>Oglio,</hi> which was the great Diſh of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and which <hi>Marius Maximus</hi> hath mentioned in his account of the Life of that Prince.</p>
                     <p>In the Afternoon, he beſtowed himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to the reading and ſigning of Letters and Orders to one part or other, in which he was attended by his Secretaries, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Requeſts; whom, if they could not conveniently ſtand by reaſon of their indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he permitted to ſit down, whilſt the Clerks read over to him the things that they had writ, to which he added with his own hand what he thought convenient, and changed ſome Terms for others, that he thought were more elegant and more juſt. After theſe were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched, he admitted the Company of all his Friends together, and ſpoke to them all, but he ſaw none of them ever alone, but his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guards, and particularly <hi>Ulpian,</hi>
                        <pb n="424" facs="tcp:52508:218"/> whom he had always had near him, to give him Light in the knowledge that he profeſſed of the things that concern Law and Juſtice. If he admitted any other privately to him, yet it was by the introduction of <hi>Ulpian. Virgil,</hi> he ſaid, was the <hi>Plato</hi> of the Poets. He had the Images of him and <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his ſecond or leſſer Oratory, together with that of <hi>Achilles</hi> and others of other great Men. But for that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> he had conſecrated him amongſt the Gods of his chief Oratory, and the beſt Perſons, whom he more eſpecially ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured there. He never did an Injury to any of his Friends, nor to any of the Officers of State, or Servants of his Houſhold. He always deferred the Judgment of particular Affairs to the Captains of the Guards. And a Captain of the Guards, he ſaid, who hath done any thing to deſerve to loſe his place, ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſecured and arraigned, than to be diſmiſſed. If at any time he diſcharged an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, he ordered it to be accompanied with a Complement, <hi>That the State thanked him for his Service.</hi> At the ſame time he failed not to gratify him in that manner, that he might live afterwards a private Life with Credit. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with Grounds, Oxen, Horſes, Corn, Iron, Materials to build himſelf a Houſe, and Marble to adorn it, and Labourers to aſſiſt him; Silver or Gold he ſeldom gave to any, unleſs it was to the Soldiers, ſaying, <hi>It would be a Crime in him, who was the publick Steward of the People, to employ that in ſuperfluities, or upon the Pleaſures of himſelf or others, which the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:52508:218"/> Provinces had contributed to ſerve the Neceſſities of the State.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He remitted the City of <hi>Rome</hi> the Duties<note place="margin">
                           <hi>His Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the City of</hi> Rome.</note> which upon certain accounts they were to pay into the Exchequer, and particularly the Duty which they were to pay to him, according to Cuſtom, upon the occaſion of his elevation to the Empire. He conſtituted fourteen Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the ſeveral Quarters of the City, out of the Perſons of the Conſular Order, whom, together with the Governour of the City, he ordered to take the Cognizance of the Civil Cauſes, in ſuch ſort, that all of them, or the greater part, ſhould be preſent, when any thing was to be done. He diſtributed all the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Victuallers, Regraters, Hoſiers, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Perſons of all Crafts, into Companies and Corporations, to whom he appointed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Officers to judge in the Diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that might ariſe amongſt them in the Matter of their ſeveral Crafts and Profeſſions. He never gave to the Players thoſe Gratuities which other Emperors have done. He made a difficulty to pay them their Salaries, and he took away from them the rich Cloaths which had been given them by <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi> His band of Archers or Penſioners, who were a Guard uſed for Pomp and Shew, more than for Service, he cloathed, not with rich, but yet proper and convenient Habits, without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity; nor were his Standards or other Royal Habiliments rich; ſaying, <hi>It was not for a Prince to ſeek his eſteem in fine Cloaths, but to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Reign by Actions of Virtue and Bravery.</hi>
                        <pb n="426" facs="tcp:52508:219"/> As for himſelf, he wore the coarſe ſhagged Coats of the Emperor <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> and Waſtcoats all plain, with no other embroidery of Gold at them, and only a ſingle Border of purple.</p>
                     <p>In his publick Entertainments, he knew not<note place="margin">Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his public En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> what it was to be ſerved in Veſſels of Gold. His Cups were ordinary, but always very neat. All the Silver-ſervice of his Table, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the quantity of two hundred Pound in weight. The Dwarfs of either Sex, the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the Singers, the Actors, the Mimicks, that had before retained to the Court, he gave away amongſt the People. And for ſuch of them as were of no uſe, he ordered them to be ſent to places, where they were maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the publick Expence, becauſe they ſhould not be troubleſome in the way of Beggars. The Eunuchs whom <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had made his great Companions in Lewdneſs, and had promoted them to high Offices, he diſtributed amongſt his Miniſters, with this Order, that if for the future they did not return to good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it ſhould be lawful for them to put them to death without attending the Authority of the Magiſtrate. Women of a Licentious Life, of whom he had heard that the number was prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, he ordered to be ſold, and the Burda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes baniſhed, with whom that Peſt <hi>Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> had taken his infamous, and abominable Pleaſures. Not a Servant in his time at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Banquet appeared in a Coat embroidered with Gold. To his private Table, he admitted either <hi>Ulpian,</hi> or ſome other Learned Men,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:52508:219"/> whoſe Converſation, he ſaid, was not only a Pleaſure to him, but it was Food to his Mind. At other times, when he eat alone, he had a Book with him upon the Table, where he read, and generally it was ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Book, though he read alſo in the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets. His publick Banquets were performed with the ſame ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity as his private Repaſts; and no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence but in the greater Number of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the Company; which ſometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceſſive, it rather offended him; ſaying, <hi>It was like Dining in a Play-houſe, or in the Cirque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He took no pleaſure to hear the Orators recite Panegyricks, or the Poets Verſes in his own Praiſe; ſaying as <hi>Peſcennius Niger</hi> had done, <hi>That it was an idle thing.</hi> But Orations or Verſes upon the Praiſe of the great Men amongſt the Antients, he heard freely, and was very well pleaſed, when either they had <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> for their ſubject, or ſome<note place="margin">
                           <hi>His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for</hi> Alexander <hi>the</hi> Great.</note> of the excellent Emperors his Predeceſſors, or of the virtuous Perſonages of <hi>Rome</hi> in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient times. He often went to hear the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians, and the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poets in the publick Schools upon ſuch Subjects. He loved to hear alſo the eloquent Pleadings of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates at Law, whether before himſelf, or before the Governour of the City. It was very agreeable to him to preſide at the publick Games; particularly thoſe that are in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> He deſired to be retired ordinarily after Dinner, and in the hour of his Levee. He never ſaw Perſons alone, as I have ſaid, and it was for this reaſon, becauſe
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:52508:220"/> he had found, that they, to whom he had ſometime granted that favour, had miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented their Converſation with him to the World. Particularly <hi>Vetronius Turinus,</hi> was one, who had very much abuſed the Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<note place="margin">Vetronius Turinus <hi>his Folly and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
                        </note> which he had treated him with. He diſhonour'd the Empire of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as of a Man, that was ſo ſtupid and ſo impertinent, that he governed him which way he pleaſed, and made him believe whatever he would; and this he pretended to make all the World believe, in order only to advance the Credit of his Intereſt, and ſo to Cheat them by the means out of their Money. But at laſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> ſurpriſed him with this Artifice. He ſent a Perſon to addreſs himſelf to him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly for ſome thing; but afterwards to take him aſide, and to pray him to ſpeak ſecretly in his favour: who promiſed him that he would; and afterwards aſſuring him, that he had done his Buſineſs to the Emperor, when really he had not ſpoken one word to him about it, and acting the ſame falſe part over again a ſecond time, and all the while exacting and receiving great recompences for his Services. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who was made acquainted with all that had paſſed, cauſed him to be accuſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted; and proving to him before all the World, upon Evidence, what Sums he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and what empty Promiſes, and falſe Reports he had made to his Client to Cheat him out of the ſame, he Condemned him to dye, and the manner of his Execution to be thus; that he ſhould be tied to a Stake, and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:52508:220"/> there be quite ſmoaked to death with green Wood and Stubble; the Common Cryer in the mean time Proclaiming his Words were Smoak, and ſo he dies with Smoak. For this was not the only Fact of the kind that he had committed. The Emperor for fear of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Cruel, had made a particular ſcrutiny into his Life before he Condemned him; and found that he often had received Money of both ſides in Cauſes, whereof he undertook the Protection; and had ſold the Events of things, in which he had had no part, and taken Money of all, who had been admitted to the Offices of Praetors, or other conſiderable Charges in the State.</p>
                     <p>With a great Retinue did this Emperor often go to the Publick Shews; but he was extremely<note place="margin">His M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Diet.</note> ſparing of his Liberality to the Actors, and ſaid, <hi>That thoſe Publick Charioteers, and Huntſmen of the Cirque, and the Players of the Stage, ought to be ſo entertained, as we do the Servants, Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Coachmen, and Jeſters of our private Families.</hi> In his Repaſts he was neither Sumptuous, nor too Frugal: his Table was neither ſplendid nor mean; but very proper without any ſuperfluity. His Carpets, ſometimes trimmed with Studs of Purple or Scarlet; but never of Cloth of Gold; as <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had uſed; and as ſome ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, it had been uſed by the Emperor <hi>Hadrian.</hi> In a word, his Table was ſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with great moderation. He indulged himſelf the moſt in Fruit. He eat very hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and ſo did he alſo drink; but without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. He waſhed always in cold Water, and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:52508:221"/> in the Summer he drank of the Wine of the infuſion of Roſes; which was the only thing that he had retained, of all the fine Wines and Methods of the invention of <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is obſervable, that he was every day ſerved at his Table with a Hare. Now there is an uſual ſaying with ſome, that <hi>Eating of Hare will make one Fair for ſeven days following;</hi> as it is ſignified in that Epigram of <hi>Martial</hi> which he writes to a Lady, whom he calls <hi>Gellia;</hi> who, always, (he ſays) when ſhe ſent him a Hare, told him, how Fair it would make him for ſo many days. To which he replies very ſeverely again upon her; <hi>That if it was true, what ſhe ſaid, certainly ſhe had never eaten of a Hare in her life.</hi> (Lib. 5. Ep. 30.) So from this vulgar conceit, a Poet in the time of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Severus</hi> took occaſion to ſay, in two or three Verſes, <hi>That as he was a</hi> Syrian <hi>born, it would be a Miracle to ſee him ſo Fair and ſo Handſom as he was, if he did not eat Veniſon and Hare continually to make him ſo.</hi> The Emperor being told of this by ſome of his Friends, it is ſaid, That he returned this anſwer; <hi>That ſo ſorry a Poet was welcome to think him Handſome from any thing. But he only wiſh'd him to eat upon nothing but Hare, till it had done as much for him; and then he would envy no body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the laſt ſervice, he drank once to the Health of his Friends, and the honour of the memory of <hi>Alexander the Great.</hi> Women he uſed moderately; and as for the diſhoneſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the other Sex, he was ſo free from them, that as I have already ſaid, he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:52508:221"/> thinking to intirely prohibit them by a Law. He eſtabliſhed publick Magazines in all the Quarters of the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe, who had not Conveniencies of their own to lodge their Proviſions, might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them, and have them lodged there with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He added Publick Baths to all the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the City, where before they were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; many of which retain his name at this day. He built very good Houſes to give them to his Friends; eſpecially ſuch as had lived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways without reproach. He moderated the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Impoſitions, ſo that he brought them down to the thirtieth part of what they were under <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi> To which purpoſe he founded a new Coin of the value of the third part of an <hi>Aureus,</hi> that is a Crown of Gold; and could he have moderated the Impoſitions ſtill more, he would have founded another new Coin of a Quarter Crown: but when he found that the publick Neceſſities of the State could not admit a Fall ſo low, he let that matter alone. The large Gold Coins of the value of two, three, four, ten, fifty, and ſome a hundred <hi>Aurei</hi> a piece, which <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had founded, he ordered to be ſuppreſſed, and melted as Coins which particularly had this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with them, they put the Emperor upon occaſions of laviſhing away more money than otherwiſe he would. Becauſe when his money is in leſſer pieces, he can moderate his Bounty better as he pleaſes.</p>

                     <p>He ſeldom wore Silks, and Velvets never;<note place="margin">Not ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.</note> nor allowed them to any in their Salaries; nor gave them in Preſents. He envied the Riches of none. He aided the Poor; eſpecially Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that he ſaw were really decayed, and yet had not brought their misfortune upon themſelves by their Luxury, he always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended as much as he could: giving them Grounds, Servants, Cattle, and Utenſils for Tillage. He viewed all the Habits himſelf that he gave away to others, and often weighed his Gold and his Silver. He gave to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Shooes, Boots, Breeches, Coats and Cloaks. The <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Purple which is ſo exquiſite, is ſo called at this day from him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was his Dier that invented it. Not that <hi>Alexander</hi> uſed it neither at all himſelf; but it was a fine Wear for the Ladies, and he obliged them to pay well for it. He often uſed a Cloak of Scarlet; but yet in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> he was always in a Gown. He never put on the <hi>Praetexta,</hi> nor the <hi>Toga Picta,</hi> that is, Robes of State ſo called, but when he was Conſul; and then they were the common Robes which are preſerved for the purpoſe in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Only, when he Sacrificed in the quality of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Pontiff, then he put on alſo the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texta.</hi> He loved plain Linen, without Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery, with either Purple or Gold. For the Purple, he ſaid, did but make it rough; whereas the excellency of Linen is it ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and the Gold made it worſe, that is ſtiff. His Stockins were always either Linen, or
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:52508:222"/> Woollen; and his Breeches White, not Scarlet; contrary to the Cuſtom of the Emperors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, whoſe Mode had been Scarlet.</p>
                     <p>The Jewels and the Pretious Stones that he had, he ſold; and put the money into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; ſaying, it was not for Men, to wear Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. He obliged the Princeſſes Royal to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with one String of Pearl; ſome Pendants for the Ears, one Necklace of Pearl, one Coronet, when they aſſiſted at the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or Sacrificed themſelves; one Gown, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd with Gold, and one Petticoat with not above ſix Ounces of Gold. He did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Office of a Cenſor, upon the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Age. The Great Men imitated him, and the Ladies of Quality followed the example of his Wife. He diminiſhed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Officers of his Houſhold: in which he made ſuch a Reform, that he retained no more Servants in any of the Offices than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity required. And therefore becauſe his Servants were few, and his whole Service of Silver that he had, was not above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound weight, when ever he made any publick Banquet, he borrowed both Plate and Servants of his Friends. He never admitted the Diverſions of the Stage-Players at his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets. He diverted himſelf the moſt in the Aviaries, that he had built in the Court. Where he had Peacocks, Feaſants, Pullets, Ducks, Partridges, and Pidgeons. Of the latter particularly, it is ſaid, that he had to the number of twenty thouſand. And becauſe their Feeding ſhould not be a burden upon
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:52508:223"/> the Publick <hi>Stores,</hi> he had Servants that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them out of the Profit that aroſe from the Eggs, and the young that they produced.</p>
                     <p>He often Bathed, both in his own Baths, and in thoſe of the Antients, in Company with the People, eſpecially in the Summer, returning from thence to the Palace in his bathing Habit, with only a Scarlet Cloak thrown over him, to mark his Dignity. His Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Footmen were always ſome of his Slaves: ſaying, a Freeman ought never to Run, but in the Sacred Games. His Cooks, Fiſhermen, Fullers, and Bagnio-men, were<note place="margin">His Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</note> always alſo Slaves; into whoſe places, as they fell, he bought others. There were in all ſeven Phyſicians to the Court under his Reign: the chief of whom received a more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry allowance. When he appointed any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the Preſidentſhips of the Provinces, he furniſhed them according to the Antient Cuſtom, as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls it in his time, with Money and Neceſſaries, that is, a Preſident of a Province received in Silver twenty pound weight, eight Mules, a couple of Horſes, two Gowns, one wearing Suit, one bathing Suit, a hundred pieces of Gold, one Cook, one Coachman; and if he had never a Wife, he was allowed one Concubine: but then at his return he was obliged to reſtore again all the Mules and the Horſes; and the Coachman and the Cook, retaining the reſt, if he had comported himſelf well. But if ill, he was obliged to reſtore fourfold; beſides the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of being Condemned for Embezel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:52508:223"/> the Publick Goods and Money, and for cheating the State; and in Actions alſo of Recovery, on the part of the particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by him unjuſtly uſed.</p>
                     <p>The Laws, that he made, are infinite. He permitted all the Senators to have their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and their Coaches at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſilvered over: believing it to be for the Honour of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Name, that the Senators of ſo great a City ſhould appear abroad in ſuch Equipages. The Conſuls, the whole year round, whether the two firſt appointed upon the Calends of <hi>January,</hi> whoſe names were entred upon the Records; or the others, the ſecondary ones, who were appointed every two Months after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, were all Nominated and Created by him, with the Advice of the Senate. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated their Expenſes; and revived and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed the days for their Elections, every two Months, in due Order. He ordered that the Quaeſtors, at their entrance into their Offices, ſhould make the accuſtomed Preſents to the People, at their own Expence; and that after their Quaeſtorſhips, they ſhould be raiſed to be Praetors, and in Conſequence to go to Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Government of the Provinces. He ſuffered the Officers who had the Guard of the Coffers of the Treaſury, to be furniſhed with Mony to make their Publick Shews to the People out of the ſaid Coffers: but this was to be done however with great management. He had it ſometime in his thoughts, ſo to diſpoſe thoſe Publick Shews throughout the whole year, that the People ſhould be entertained with them
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:52508:224"/> once in every thirty days. But why he did not do it, is a thing that remains under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of ſilence. Upon the ſeventh day of the Week, if he was in Town, he went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for his Devotions to the Capitol. At other times he went often to the other Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. He was willing to have built a Temple<note place="margin">His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Chriſt.</note> unto Chriſt; and had a deſign to receive him into the number of the Gods, as it was alſo ſometime in the thoughts of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> it is ſaid, to do; who had expreſly order'd, in all Cities, Temples to be built without Images; which at this day being left unfiniſhed and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated are called the Temples of <hi>Hadrian:</hi> who had however diſpoſed them for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but then he was hindred from procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any further by thoſe who having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Affairs of Religion had found, that all the World would turn Chriſtian, if this thing was once ſuffered, and the other Temples would be deſerted.</p>
                     <p>He made very pleaſant Railleries; and was of an agreeable Converſation: and he was kind and gracious in his Entertainments; in which it was permitted to ask him, whatever one would. He was intent upon the amaſſing of Money, Prudent in preſerving it; and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious to find it where it was; but however without doing a prejudice to any. He would not be ſaid to be a <hi>Syrian;</hi> but boaſted himſelf to be Originally a <hi>Roman,</hi> by thoſe from whom he had the Honour to Deſcend; and whoſe Genealogy he drew, in which he ſhews, that his Family was Deſcended from the <hi>Marcelli.</hi>
                        <pb n="437" facs="tcp:52508:224"/> To the Rhetoricians, Grammarians, Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Soothſayers, Aſtrologers, Geometricians, and Architects, he appointed Salaries, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Schools to Teach in, and ſent them Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that is, Children of a free condition, but of little or no Fortunes; for whoſe Education he allowed them himſelf. He deferred a great deal alſo in the Provinces to the Advocates at Law, and where he hath found, that they have Pleaded Gratis, which a great many did, he encouraged them, and gratified them. He confirmed the Laws from year to year, and carefully kept them in his own Perſon. He went often to take the Divertiſement of the Stage, and had deſigned to repair the Theatre of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> To ſeveral Cities, that had been defaced by Earthquakes, he allowed Money out of the Taxes towards the Rebuilding of their Publick and Private Edifices. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver employed but very little Silver upon the Temples, and not one Leaf of Gold; having always in his Mouth that Verſe of <hi>Perſius,</hi>
                        <q>—In Sacris quid facit Aurum?</q> That is, What ſhould Gold do in ſacred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>
                     <p>I come now to ſpeak of his Expeditions of War; which I ſhall do in their order: And in the firſt place I ſhall obſerve what his Cuſtom was, as to theſe, for things, that were to be held in ſilence, and others that he diſcover'd. He never diſcovered the ſecret Deſign; but yet the day that he was to march up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was two Months before Proclaimed in a
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:52508:225"/> Publick Edict in theſe words; <hi>Upon ſuch a Day, and ſuch an hour I ſhall depart from this City; and by the help of the Gods I ſhall march the firſt day to ſuch a place;</hi> and ſo he told his ſeveral Stations and Encampments in order; and marked the places, where he was to receive in Proviſions, as far as till he arrived upon the Frontiers of the Country of the Barbarians: for from thence all things were huſhed, and all marched without the Barbarians being able to know the deſign of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. It is certain, that he never was deceived in any deſign that he propoſed; becauſe his Counſels were never ſold by his Courtiers; as all things under <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had been by the Eunuchs; who are a ſort of Creatures that will be always Prying into all the Secrets of the Court, to the end to appear to be the only Perſons from whom nothing is hid; that they may obtain by that means what they deſire; whether it is to ſatisfie their Vanity, or their Avarice. In the mean time, in his Choice of Perſons to<note place="margin">His Choice of Publick Officers.</note> be either Governors, or Procurators, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers, or other great Officers in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, he firſt propoſed their names to the People; and deſired them, that if they knew any Crime of which they ſuſpected and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged any of thoſe Perſons to be guilty, he ſhould be put to juſtifie himſelf by certain Proofs; or otherwiſe anſwer for it, with his Head. For it was not a thing fit, he ſaid, <hi>That the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and the</hi> Jews <hi>ſhould do this for the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their Prieſts, that are propoſed to be Ordained; and that it ſhould not be done as to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:52508:225"/> the Governours of Provinces, unto whom are committed the Fortunes and the Lives of ſo many Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He appointed Salaries to thoſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Aſſeſſours; attending upon the Governors of the Provinces: but yet he often ſaid, That <hi>ſuch Perſons eſpecially ought to be promoted to the Government of the Provinces, who know how to Govern by themſelves, and not by Aſſeſſours:</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>that the Men of the Sword have their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations proper to them; and the Men of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters theirs; and ſo every one ought to act according to the knowledge that he hath.</hi> Treaſure that had been hidden and was found, he gave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way amongſt ſuch as had found it: only if it was very much, he added ſome of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to them. He took their names down in Writing, and refreſhed his memory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with upon any occaſion, to whom he ever<note place="margin">His pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality.</note> gave any thing: and if he knew ſome, that had askt him nothing, or very little, whereby to augment their Fortunes, he ſpoke to them and ſaid, <hi>What is the matter, that you ask me for nothing? Do you intend to make me your Debtour? Ask me, for fear I ſhould be reduced to be a private Man again, and then you ſhould complain of me.</hi> What he beſtowed by way of Gifts, were Eſtates of Malefactors Condemned, excepting the Gold, Silver, and Jewels; for all that was remitted into the Coffers of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.</hi> Then he diſpoſed of the Offices in the Army, and the Governments of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other Civil Offices in the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: where he changed his Receivers from
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:52508:226"/> time to time. Not one of them accompliſh'd a full year; indeed he hated them, though they might be Men of Honeſty too; becauſe, he ſaid, <hi>They were Neceſſary Evils.</hi> As for the Preſidents, Proconſuls, and Generals, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made thoſe by Favour, or with the ſingle deſign to enrich them: but he made them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Judgment of the Senate, or the beſt of his own.</p>
                     <p>He diſpoſed his Armies in the time of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,<note place="margin">His Care of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> ſo that they received their Proviſions in the places where they rendevouz'd; without carrying with them Subſiſtance for more than ſeventeen days; unleſs it was in the Country of the Enemy, and there he alſo aſſiſted them with Mules and Camels; ſaying, That <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to look more after his Men, than himſelf; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Publick Safety was in them.</hi> He vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited them (when Sick) in their Tents; even thoſe of the loweſt Ranks; and cauſed them to be carried upon Waggons, and to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with all ſorts of Neceſſaries. But if they were too Sick to Travel, he recommended them to the care of the good Houſekeepers, and the virtuous Women in the Cities and the Villages, where he paſſed; to whom he paid the Charges of their looking after, whether they recovered or died.</p>

                           <hi>Story of</hi> Camillus.</note> Family, had once the Vanity, being conceited on that account, to think of Revolting, and ſetting up himſelf to be Emperor. Which being Diſcovered, and certainly Proved to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Severus,</hi> he ſent for him to the Court.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:52508:226"/> Telling him, <hi>That he gave him Thanks, that he was ſo willing to take upon him the Care of the Empire; how contrary ſoever it was to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of others, that yet were good Men.</hi> So he took him with him to the Senate, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him his Colleague. In the mean time <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi> was in the greateſt Confuſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of Conſcience. He received him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards into the Court; and admitted him to his Table, and Habited him with the ſame Imperial Ornaments, or better than his own. Then the War againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he asked him if he would go to it and bear him Company. They began their march together on Foot; <hi>Severus,</hi> earneſtly inviting him to bear the Fatigue with Patience. But after five Miles walking, <hi>Camillus</hi> tired; and then <hi>Severus</hi> ordered him a Horſe. After two days more march, he was tired again with his Horſe; and then <hi>Severus</hi> put him upon a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but yet neither did this make him ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: but whether it was with Fear, or that he truly deſired no more of the Glory that attended thoſe Travels; he Abdicated the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with all his Heart, and would rather have died than continued in it. Then <hi>Severus</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him, and ſent him under a Guard, whom he deſired to take a care of him, Home, to his own Houſe in the Country in ſafety; where he afterwards lived a long time; but was at laſt killed by the Soldiers, but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Command of the Emperor, who had altogether gained his Heart, and had treated him with ſo much Humanity. I know very
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:52508:227"/> well, that this hath been thought amongſt the Vulgar to have been the Action of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Trajan.</hi> But ſince neither <hi>Marius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> hath taken any notice of it, nor <hi>Fabius Marcellinus,</hi> nor <hi>Aurelius Verus,</hi> nor <hi>Statius Valens,</hi> who have all of them written the Life of that Prince: And on the contrary, ſince <hi>Septimius, Acholius,</hi> and <hi>Encolpius,</hi> who have written the Life of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> and all others that ſpeak of him, have remarked this Action to be his; I hope that the Authority upon which I alſo do ſo, will appear to be of more Weight and Credit; than vulgar Fame, and any common Rumour of the People.</p>
                     <p>He never ſuffered Offices, to which belong'd Power of Life and Death, to be ſold: ſaying, <hi>He that Buyes, muſt neceſſarily Sell again in his turn. But I will have no Merchandiſe made of the Powers of that Nature; ſhould I ſuffer them, it would not be in my power to Condemn them. For I ſhould be aſhamed to puniſh a Man that Sells as he Buyes, to make up his Accounts.</hi> He made Ordinances touching the College of the Chief Prieſts, the Commiſſion of the <hi>Quindecimviri,</hi> or fifteen Prieſts for Religious Affairs, and the College of the Augurs; which merited to be<note place="margin">He fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> received in the Senate.

Where-ever the Legions marched, the Tribunes, the Centurions, the Soldiers were ſo quiet, ſo modeſt, and ſo belov'd for their Diſcretion; and then the Preſence of their Prince was accompanied with ſo many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualities; that the People of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces conſidered him as a God.

They were handſomely Cloathed, and nobly Armed: their Cavalry well mounted, and compleatly Furniſhed and Capariſoned: ſo that to ſee the Army of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Severus,</hi> it was enough to give one an Ieda of the Grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. He particularly, with all his Power, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to appear worthy of the name that he carried, and which is more, to ſurpaſs the <hi>Macedonian</hi> of the ſame: and ſaid, <hi>That there ought to be a great difference betwixt</hi> Alexander <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Alexander <hi>of</hi> Macedon. He had Companies in his Army, as that <hi>Macedonian</hi> had, that were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="444" facs="tcp:52508:228"/> of thirty thouſand Men, whom he called by the name of his <hi>Phalangieres;</hi> by whoſe means he did a great many Noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in <hi>Perſia.</hi> This <hi>Phalanx</hi> was compoſed of Six Legions, who were all equally well armed, and for their great Services judged worthy to be all at double Pay after the end of the War of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Royal Preſents, which were made him, he beſtowed upon the Temples; but Jewels he ſold: becauſe he thought it was an Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thing to keep Jewels; which are neither fit to be given amongſt the Soldiers, nor to be worn by a Man of Bravery. An Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour having preſented his Wife, the Empreſs, by him, with two <hi>Unions</hi> of a great Weight, and an extraordinary Size, he ordered them to be ſold; but there was no body to be found to come up to the Price. And for fear that they ſhould draw from the Empreſs herſelf, an ill Example, if ſhe uſed a thing that was not to be Purchaſed, he Dedicated them to ſerve for Pendants to the Ears of a Statue of <hi>Venus.</hi> His Protectour in his Minority was <hi>Ulpian;</hi> to whom his Mother <hi>Mammaea</hi> was at firſt averſe; but afterwards ſhe thanked him, when ſhe ſaw that her Son had attained to be ſo great an Emperor, by following eſpecially his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, in the Government of himſelf and the State. And yet <hi>Ulpian</hi> laboured under the ill will of the Soldiers; and but that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror defended him, certainly they would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have murdered him in his Preſence. In all his Marches, and all his Expeditions, he
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:52508:228"/> dined and ſupped in Publick, with his Tents open for all the Soldiers to ſee him, which pleaſed them well. He eat the common<note place="margin">His ſtrict Diſcipli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If in Marching any one had but ſtepped aſide to take the leaſt thing from the Inhabitants of the Country, where-ever it was, he was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaten with Rods in his preſence, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in a Mulct; or if his Quality had ſet him above this, he reprimanded him himſelf publickly, to make him aſhamed, and ſaid, <hi>Would you be willing that this ſhould have been done upon your own Eſtate, which you do to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's?</hi> It was a great Expreſſion with him at all times, <hi>Do not that to another, which you would not that another ſhould do to you;</hi> whether he had heard it from the <hi>Jews</hi> or from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, he retained it well, and it was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conformable to his Sentiments. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ordered it to be proclaimed by the common Cryer, when he corrected any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He loved it ſo, that he made Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it upon his own Palace, and upon the publick Works.</p>
                     <p>Having been told once that a poor old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had been outragiouſly injured by a Soldier, who was by Trade a Carpenter, he not only caſhiered him the Army, but gave him to be the Woman's Slave, to maintain her ever after, by his Labour. And though the Soldiers complained of this, he perſuaded them all to ſupport with patience ſuch an Example of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:52508:229"/> Diſcipline, and at the ſame time he made them to fear him. His Reign was without Blood in this Senſe, that he ſpilt not the Blood of any one of the Senators, as the <hi>Grecian</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian <hi>Herodian</hi> hath obſerved; but yet he ſhewed a great deal of ſharpneſs, and of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in his Reign; and eſpecially, he was ſo rigorous upon the Soldiers, that he often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded entire Legions of them at a time; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fearing the Mutineers of his Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew that they could ſay nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Life, nor could reproach him, that the Tribunes or the Captains under his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, had ever retained any thing of their Pay from them. <hi>And when a Soldier is well cloathed and armed, his Belly full, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his Purſe, then,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>it is that he the moſt fears you; for it is Neceſſity that reduces Soldiers to all ſorts of Deſpair.</hi> In fine, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Officers of the Army to be waited upon by none but Soldiers, whoſe Number was limited; that is, he ordered, that there ſhould be four Soldiers to march always before a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, ſix before a Commander, and ten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a General.</p>
                     <p>Now to the end to ſhew you his Severity,<note place="margin">An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his ſteady Severity.</note> and how he carried himſelf in his Affairs with his Soldiers, it will be convenient to give you one of of his Harangues that he made to them. When he was come to the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and had been told one day, that ſome of the Soldiers had put themſelves into the Baths there with the Women of Pleaſure, he ordered them all to be taken, and laid in Irons. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:52508:229"/> known to the Legion unto which thoſe Soldiers belonged, they were all immediately in a Mutiny. He called a Council of War, and the Priſoners being all brought before him, and all the other Soldiers ſtanding round about him in their Arms, he ſpoke thus;</p>
                     <p>My Fellow Soldiers,</p>
                     <p>I <hi>Hope, you will be eaſily perſuaded to diſallow with me, the things that have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome of your Comrades. For the Diſcipline of our Anceſtors is what muſt neceſſarily take place here, if we would preſerve the State. For when once that Diſcipline is loſt, then adieu to the Glory of the</hi> Roman <hi>Name, and the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire. Nor is it to be ſuffered, that Men ſhould take the ſame Liberties in my Reign, which late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did under the Debaucheries which were committed in the time of the impure</hi> Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus. <hi>Shall the</hi> Roman <hi>Soldiers, your Comrades, and my Fellow-Companions in Arms and War, Drink, Bath, Whore, and live in all the ſoft and luxurious ways of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and ſhall I endure this long, and thoſe there, ſhall I not puniſh them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With this the Tumult increaſed, and they ſet up a Clamour againſt him. But he went on and ſaid;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nay, keep your Clamours to terrifie your Enemy in the Field, and beſtow them not in vain upon your Emperor. Certainly your Maſters who firſt taught you Arms, have told you, that you are to cry out ſo againſt the <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi>
                           <pb n="448" facs="tcp:52508:230"/> the <hi>Perſians</hi> your Enemies, and not againſt him who out of the Contributions of the Provinces feeds you, and gives you Cloaths, and gives you your Pay. Forbear then that ſavage Noiſe, which is only fit for Battel, leſt in a word, and in a breath, this day I break you all, and ſend you home to your Houſes, ſcarcely with the Name of <hi>Romans.</hi> For how deſerve ye, to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the leaſt of the Common People of <hi>Rome,</hi> unleſs you acknowledge the Right of the Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here they began to grow worſe, and to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace him with their Swords. He went on;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Threaten your Enemy, and turn your Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, if you are ſo Valiant; me you do not affright with it: and ſhould you kill here a ſingle Man, the Empire, the Senate will not be wanting to me, the People of <hi>Rome</hi> will revenge me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They ſtill murmuring not the leſs for this, he cried with a loud voice, <hi>I disband you, be gone, and lay down your Arms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After theſe words, they all laying down their Arms, and diſcharging themſelves of their Military Accountrements, by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Example, retired every one, not to the Camp, but up and down to the Inns, which was the firſt time that he made it appear what his Severity could do. In fine, his Guards that had attended upon his Perſon, took up the Standards that the others had laid
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:52508:230"/> down, and carried them to the Camp, and their Arms were gathered up by the People, and brought to the Palace. But however, this Legion which he had thus caſhier'd, in thirty days afterwards, upon Interceſſion made for them, before he ſet forward to engage the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he reſtored again to the ſame Rank which they had held before in the Army; and the Bravery which they in particular ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that occaſion, in which they did Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was the great thing that gained him the Victory. Some of the Officers, in the mean time, he had not ſpared to puniſh with death, becauſe it had been by their negligence, that the Soldiers had been ſo debauched with the Pleaſures of <hi>Daphne,</hi> and becauſe they had not taken the Care that was ſufficient to have hindred this Sedition of the Army.</p>
                     <p>He marched from the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> to give Battle to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> well provided, and with great magnificence. <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<note place="margin">
                           <hi>He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats the</hi> Perſians.</note> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> came againſt him with ſeven hundred Elephants, one thouſand and eight hundred armed Chariots, and a Body of Horſe of many thouſands. But the Victory was on the ſide of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, who in the Fight viſited the one and the other Wing, and encouraged the Soldiers, and was often within Perils himſelf, and ſignalized his Valour with his own hand. After which, he returned again to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and made his Army rich with the Booty that they took, and the Depredations that he permitted the Tribunes, the Captains, and the Soldiers to make upon
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:52508:231"/> the Provinces of the Enemy. The <hi>Perſians</hi> then firſt began to ſubmit to the Dominion of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But becauſe the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> think it an Indignity for thoſe that belong to them to be made Slaves, he ſent their Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, and the Priſoners were reſtored, and the Money given either to ſuch as had taken them Priſoners, or elſe put into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury</p>
                     <p>After this noble Expedition he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he received the honour of a Triumph,<note place="margin">He tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.</note> performed with great Magnificence, and then he made this Speech to the Senate upon the occaſion; which I have taken out of the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Senate, upon the ſeventh day of the Kalends of <hi>October.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fathers of the Senate,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>WE have vanquiſhed the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and we have no need of any great Eloquence to recount the particulars to you. You may pleaſe only to know, what their Arms were, and how well provided they came. They came with ſeven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Elephants, and this is the firſt time that we have ever ſeen in the Field ſo great a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and theſe carried Towers upon their backs full of Archers, and Loads of Arrows. Three Hundred of theſe we took, Two Hundred more were killed upon the place and Eighteen we have brought hither with us. Then they had Eighteen Hundred Chariots, armed with cutting Scythes. We could have brought with us of thoſe Chariots Two Hundred, whereof the Beaſts were killed. But however, we thought fit to forbear that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:52508:231"/> it is an eaſie thing to make them ourſelves. We have cut in pieces an Army of a hundred and twenty thouſand Horſe; and ten thouſand Compleat Cuiraſſiers, with whoſe Spoils we have armed our Men. We took a great number of the <hi>Perſians</hi> Priſoners, whom we have ſold. The Country of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> betwixt the two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which had been ſo neglected by my Impure Prodeceſſour, <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus,</hi> we have Re-conquered and received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Obedience. We have put the moſt Potent King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as he is entituled; but who is ſo in effect, as well as by Name, to flight. The Country of <hi>Perſia</hi> beheld him flying; and in the ſame place, where the <hi>Romans</hi> heretofore in the defeat of <hi>Craſſus</hi> loſt their Banners, the <hi>Perſians</hi> now have left us theirs. You ſee, Fathers of the Senate, what we have Atchieved; the Subject needs no Eloquence to adorn it. The Army is come home Rich. None think their Pains too great, that Conquer. It is for you to appoint Publick Thankſgivings to be made upon this occaſion; to the end that we may not ſeem ungrateful to the Gods for the ſucceſs of our Arms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Acclamations of the Senate followed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Gods preſerve our Emperor, <hi>Alexander,</hi> Conquerour of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> We Congratulate your Majeſty, your moſt great Victory; your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath merited moſt truly the Name of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Parthians.</hi> The Gods ſave you.

By you we will hope for Victory over the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> By you we will hope for Victory from all Parts. Your Majeſty takes the way to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.

                     <p>Then the Senate Adjourning, he went from thence to the Capitol: where having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Sacred Ceremonies, and Dedicated to the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſome Armour of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to be hung up there, he ſpoke to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After all theſe things, full of Glory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the Senate, the Order of the Gentry, and all the People, through Crowds of Women and Children on all ſides, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Soldiers Wives; contemplating his Preſence and his Meen, and obſerving him as he paſſed with admiration. He marched from the Capitol to the Palace, on Foot; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a Triumphal Chariot, drawn by four Elephants. He was ſo born up in the Hands of all People; that he ſcarce finiſhed this Space in four Hours, and from all ſides they cried, how happy is <hi>Rome</hi> in ſuch a Prince. The following day, was ſpent in the Games of the <hi>Cirque,</hi> and the Diverſions of the Stage. And then he gave the Poor a Largeſs; and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Penſions for the maintenance of the Children of the Poor, according to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Antoninus Pius;</hi> and in the Honour of his Mother <hi>Mammaea,</hi> thoſe Children were called the <hi>Children of</hi> Mammaea.</p>
                     <p>The Affairs of the Province of <hi>Mauritania</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes by his Ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerals.</note> 
                        <hi>Tingitana</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> had been in the mean time very ſucceſsful under <hi>Furius Celſus;</hi> as were thoſe of the Province of <hi>Illyricum</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Varius Macrinus,</hi> his Kinſman; and thoſe of <hi>Armenia</hi> under <hi>Junius Palmetus:</hi> ſo that from all places they ſent him Letters, Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Lawrels; which being publickly Read to the Senate and the People, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf adorned and ſaluted by all the Titles that could appertain to him. Therefore as for
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:52508:233"/> Men that had behaved themſelves ſo well in the Provinces, committed unto their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet had never been Conſuls, he appointed them the Honour of wearing the ſame Marks and Ornaments, as thoſe that had. He put them into Eſtates, if they were Poor and advanced in years; and gave them Places in the College of the Prieſts. He gave the Captives that he had made of divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, amongſt his Friends; unleſs they were of Royal Blood, or of more than Ordinary Quality; and then he Deputed them to the Services of War, but in no great Poſts. The Lands of the Enemy, which were Conquered upon the Frontiers, were given by his conſent amongſt the Officers and Soldiers; under a Condition that their Heirs after them ſhould be obliged to take to Arms; and that thoſe Lands ſhould never come to Perſons of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Condition; becauſe he ſaid, that the thoughts that they were to defend their own Eſtates, would make them fight more freely. He furniſhed them with Cattle and Servants, neceſſary for Tillage; leſt either through the want of Hands, or the Old Age of the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors, the ſaid Places ſhould come to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned again; which he thought would be a thing very ſhameful.</p>
                     <p>After theſe things, foraſmuch as he lived in a great love and eſteem of the Senate and the People, they were unwilling to let him go to the War againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> although they all hoped for Victory from his Arms. <hi>Gallia</hi> was at this time inceſſantly ravaged by
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:52508:233"/> the Incurſiosn of that People: which was a matter of great trouble to the State, and to himſelf; and that which yet encreaſed their reſentments, was, that after the reduction of the Country of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and the defeat of the Forces of ſo great a People as the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the Nation of the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould now menace the Heads of the State, which yet had been always ſubject to Emperors, that had not Reigned with ſo much Glory. So he enterpriſed this Voyage by great Marches, and all the Soldiery were very much pleaſed with it. But yet meeting again in <hi>Gallia</hi> with ſome Mutinous Legions, which he rejected; and the <hi>Gauls</hi> being of a Temper to be hot and fierce, and often troubleſome to their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, they could not find themſelves diſpoſed to ſupport a Treatment which was ſo ſevere, eſpecially after ſo ſoft a Reign as that of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus;</hi> And whether that it was they, or <hi>Maximin</hi> that had ſet Aſſaſſines upon him, he was killed at a Village called <hi>Cecil,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Bretagn;</hi> not by a conſent of all, but by a party of Soldiers, who took their oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do it, when he had few Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. At the ſame time they inveigh'd outragiouſly againſt him and againſt his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as a Covetous Woman, earneſt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs Riches; and by whoſe Counſel he had acted in all things. He Reigned thirteen years and nine days; and had lived twenty nine years, three months and ſeven days, And his Mother <hi>Mammaea</hi> was killed with him.</p>

                     <p>The Signs that fore ran his death, were<note place="margin">Omens of his Death.</note> theſe. Upon the Anniverſary of his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, as he aſſiſted at the Sacrifice, the Beaſt, which was the Victim, betook itſelf to its feet, and would have eſcaped in its blood: and ruſhing into the Company, where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was, it left ſome of its blood upon his Robes. A large and old Laurel, at a certain place where he paſſed to the War, dyed on a ſudden. Three Figtrees, to which his Tent had been faſtened, and which were of thoſe ſort, that they call the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Figs, dyed alſo on a ſudden. A Woman, that was a <hi>Druid</hi> cried after him in her Language, You may go; but never hope for Victory, nor truſt to your Army. He began an Harangue, that he made to his Soldiers, before he went to ſeek the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, with theſe fatal words; <hi>The Emperor</hi> Heliogabalus <hi>having been killed.</hi> But all theſe things however he mightily deſpiſed; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf upon his March to meet the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he was killed at the Place above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                     <p>He had Dined that day, as it was his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to do, Publickly, and had eaten of the common Bread, and Proviſions of the Army; nor, when his Tent was ſearched and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſackt, was there any thing extraordinary found in it. After Dinner, as he had repoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Sleep a little, which was about the hour of One, a Spy of the Conſpirators, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Guards, had entred into his Tent, and had found him awake; but every body elſe aſleep: and the Emperor ſeeing him,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:52508:234"/> ſaid; <hi>What is the matter, my Friend: any News of the Enemy?</hi> The Man withdrew to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and ſpurred them on to the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, by the excellency of the Opportunity, which offered itſelf. So a great number of them immediately broke in, and cutting off every one they found, they came to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and ſtruck him ſeveral times through the Body; of which he died inſtantly. Some ſay, that there was not a word ſpoken; but only the Soldiers cryed to him, Away with you! Be gone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximin,</hi> who ſucceeded him, and who carried on the War againſt the Enemy ſerved himſelf, for that purpoſe, of all the Military Preparations of this Prince. Amongſt the reſt, eſpecially of all the Auxiliaries of the <hi>Armenians, Meſopotamians, Parthians,</hi> and others out of the Eaſt; becauſe being excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, none were of greater uſe againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> than they.</p>
                     <p>His contempt of Death had ſhown itſelf not only in that fierceneſs, with which he had always humbled the Soldiers; but alſo in this. That when <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> an Aſtrologer, who was his particular Favourite, had told him; that his Fate was to dye by the <hi>Sword of the Barbarians,</hi> he was glad of it, in the Opinion which he had, that he was like to dye in the Field of Battel; which he <hi>thought a death wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an Emperor.</hi> Then he argued upon it, and obſerved, <hi>what excellent Men in all times, have died Violent Deaths,</hi> in which number he recounted the <hi>Great Alexander</hi> of his own
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:52508:235"/> name; <hi>Pompey, Julius Caeſar, Demoſthenes, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> and other famous Perſonages; ſo that he deſired no greater Honour than to die in the Field of Battel. He believed that it would make him comparable to the Gods. But he miſtook the Prediction, for he died not in the Field of Battel; although it was in the time of a War; and yet died by the <hi>Sword of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian.</hi> For that Spy, who had firſt broken into his Tent, was a <hi>German,</hi> and one that killed him.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of the Army were ſenſibly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his death, and revenged it upon the Authors of it: and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> all the Senate, and all the Provinces never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented any thing worſe. Nor were they leſs aſtoniſhed, when they heard that he was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Empire by <hi>Maximin,</hi> and his Son. Wherein all the World judged very well the hard neceſſity of his Deſtiny; becauſe they ſaw a Man raiſed to his place, who was of no Birth nor Breeding, and whoſe groſs Ruſticity gave them an occaſion to apprehend all things. The Senate Conſecrated him a God; and a Monument was Erected to his Memory in <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> whilſt his Body was interred in a moſt Noble Sepulchre at <hi>Rome.</hi> His Prieſts were appointed, as likewiſe his Feſtival; which is at this day Celebrated with great Devotion. But ſome pretend to ſay, that the occaſion of his Murther was; becauſe by his Mother's advice he was for quitting the War againſt the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and for returning, out of Vanity, with her again into the Eaſt. But to ſay the truth,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:52508:235"/> I take this to be nothing but a Fiction of the Creatures of <hi>Maximin;</hi> to the end, that it ſhould not be thought that ſo very good an Emperor had been killed by their Friend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God and Man.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the Empire of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath had for the moſt part Princes, whoſe Reigns have been in their duration ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderable. But after <hi>Alexander Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> aroſe many, who as they had haſtily ruſht in, ſo they were as haſtily, one after another, driven away from the Throne again. For ſome Reigned half a year: ſome a year: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perhaps reached to two years: but three is the moſt, till we come to thoſe Princes who far extended the bounds of the Empire; I would ſay <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and thoſe that follow; of whoſe Lives, as much as we can find to be ſaid hereafter; we ſhall not fail to write and publiſh it.</p>
                     <p>That which is Condemned in <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Faults of</hi> Severus.</note> is; that he denyed his Native Country, and would not at all paſs for a <hi>Syrian;</hi> that he loved Money; was extremely Suſpicious; invented many new Taxes; deſired to appear as another <hi>Alexander the Great;</hi> was too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere upon the Soldiers; and was too inquiſitive into the Affairs of particular Perſons. But as for thoſe who deny, that he had not been Created a <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the Senate, but by the Soldiers; or that he was the Couſin German of <hi>Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> they are greatly miſtaken; and to ſee their error, let them peruſe, as we have done,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:52508:236"/> the Hiſtorians of his time; eſpecially <hi>Acholius,</hi> who is very particular upon him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Your Majeſty, O moſt Sacred</hi> Conſtantine, is pleaſed many times to ask; from whence it comes, that a Stranger and a <hi>Syrian</hi> did make ſuch an excellent Prince; when ſuch a great number of others of <hi>Roman</hi> Blood, and out of the Provinces of the Empire, that have Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have been Wicked, Impure, Cruel, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Unjuſt and Diſſolute. I humbly deſire therefore your Majeſty to obſerve, as to this; that according to the Sentiments of good Men, Nature which is the Common Mother of us all, is ſufficient to Act in this ſort, and ſo he might be Born a good Prince. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he had an Example immediately before his Eyes, of a very ill Prince that was killed, and after his Death diſhonoured; and the fear which is ſuggeſted by ſuch a Fate, could not but have an influence upon him, to make him better. But becauſe theſe Reaſons are a little remote, and too general, and I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that I ought to ſuggeſt the Truth to Your Majeſty, I ſhall refer my ſelf to your Royal Goodneſs, and your Clemency, in declaring what at leaſt I have read upon this Subject. Your Majeſty remembers very well, what no doubt you have ſeen in <hi>Marius Maximus;</hi> that a State in which the Prince is himſelf bad, but his Counſellours good, is in a better Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in much greater Safety, than when the Prince is good, but his Counſellours are bad. For certainly one ill Genius may very well be Amended and Corrected by many, that are
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:52508:236"/> good. But a great many, that are all bad, will never be Corrected by one, let him be never ſo good. And this is what was once ſaid by <hi>Homullus,</hi> unto the Emperor <hi>Trajan;</hi> where he compared the Examples of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> with one another. <hi>Domitian,</hi> he ſaid, was a very ill Prince, but yet he had Counſellours that were good. <hi>Claudius</hi> was not ſo ill a Prince as <hi>Domitian;</hi> but his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours were bad. But yet <hi>Claudius</hi> was of the two the moſt hated in his time. And certainly it is always better to ſuffer under the weight of one that is bad, than under many.</p>
                     <p>But to return to my purpoſe. It is true, that <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> was a very excellent Perſon himſelf; and was alſo directed by the good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels always of his Mother, who was a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Woman; which laſt thing alone is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great Argument of his goodneſs. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this; he was ſerved by Counſellors who<note place="margin">Character of his Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</note> were Holy and Venerable Perſonages: without Malice, without Faction, without Knavery, without inclination to Evil, without Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the Virtuous; without Diſſoluteneſs, without Cruelty, without deſign of Surpriſing, or Mocking, or making a Property of their Prince. But full of Integrity, Venerable, Continent, Religious, lovers of their Prince; they expoſed nothing that he did; nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it in others: they made a ſecret Gain to themſelves in nothing; they falſified nothing; they Diſſembled nothing; they never betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and they loved, and advanced his Reputation. Add to this another thing, that
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:52508:237"/> he Baniſhed the Eunuchs from his Counſels, and his Service; as being the only Creatures who ruin Princes. For it is they, that have put them upon the living after the Examples of Foreign Nations; and the Mode eſpecially of the Kings of <hi>Perſia;</hi> that ſow Diviſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the beſt Prince and his People; that are Spyes from ſide to ſide; and report an anſwer contrariwiſe often, than it is given, and keep their Prince lock'd up, and carry all things ſo ſecretly, that he knows nothing. For being but Slaves bought with a Price, how ſhould we expect better from them? <hi>No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alexander Severus, My Captains, Conſuls, and Senators, ſhall never lye at the mercy of Slaves, that are bought and ſold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible, <hi>Great Sir,</hi> of the danger which there is in ſpeaking theſe things before an Emperor, who ſhould repoſe himſelf in ſuch hands as theſe, and ſhould be the Slave of theſe Slaves. But our Felicity is, that as ſoon as Your Majeſty had well underſtood, what Miſchiefs theſe Peſts do bring along with them, and how they Circumvent the Princes whom they ſerve; You, out of your Royal Care to the Intereſts of the State, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to that paſs, that you ſuffer them not to continue within your Houſhold; not ſo much as to be your Menial Servants.</p>
                     <p>Another eminent thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> which Contributed to the Felicity of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> is this; that he ſaw no one at the Court alone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was his Captain of the Guards, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Ulpian.</hi> For otherwiſe he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:52508:237"/> Company preſent; to the end, to give to no Perſon whatſoever an opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting their Converſation with him falſly to others, nor of ſpeaking ill of others to him. Eſpecially he did this after the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that he took of <hi>Turinus;</hi> who had often vaunted of ſpeaking things to him, which he never did; and of receiving anſwers from him, which he never gave him; and this, only to ſqueeze Money, and enrich himſelf by that means out of the Pockets of his Clients; though at the ſame time he made a Cully and a Fool of his Maſter.</p>
                     <p>To all which we muſt add, that if <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Severus</hi> had found, that either his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors or his very Relations had done ill, he puniſhed them; or if the Obligations of his former Friendſhip with, or his nearer Alliance to them, did not ſuffer him to puniſh them; yet he ſent them from him; and ſaid, <hi>The whole State is dearer to me than theſe.</hi>

                     <head type="sub">VOL. II.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>MAXIMIN</hi> the Firſt was a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian</hi> Born, of a Village of the Province of <hi>Romania,</hi> that is, the Antient <hi>Thrace.</hi> His Father's<note place="margin">His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> Name was <hi>Mecca,</hi> his Mother's <hi>Hababa:</hi> The one a <hi>Goth,</hi> the other an <hi>Alan.</hi> Under the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52508:251"/> became firſt a Soldier. Under the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> he Riſe and Flouriſh'd; inſomuch that he ſucceeded him in the Empire; and being unwilling, after he was Emperor, to have it known, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Mother were both <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he ordered the Names of them, which he had diſcovered at the beginning, to be as much as was poſſible, ſuppreſſed again, and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the World.</p>
                     <p>He was a Shepherd in the beginning of his Youth; and as he grew, he ſometimes even then, was the Champion of the Village of which he was. His Firſt Service as a Soldier, was amongſt the Horſe, becauſe of his great ſize and ſtrength of Body, which fitted him more eſpecially and cut him out for a Trooper. He acquitted himſelf in that Quality to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. He was of a Manly Look, Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewn, Fierce, Proud, apt to Contemn; which yet did not hinder him from being oftentimes Juſt in what he did. The Occaſion which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd<note place="margin">His Riſe.</note> him into the Knowledge of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> was this: That Prince, upon the Birth of <hi>Geta</hi> his younger Son, appointed a Divertiſement of ſome Games and Exerciſes to be performed by the Soldiers, and propoſed Prizes for the Conquerors, in pieces of Silver of fine Bracelets, Collars, and little Bells. <hi>Maximin</hi> was as yet a Youth, and could ſcarce ſpeak the Latin Tongue. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he took the Courage upon him, in Words which were partly Latin and partly <hi>Thracian,</hi> publickly to beg leave of the Emperor, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52508:251"/> he might try his Skill againſt ſome who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Liſts, and who were Men of a more than ordinary Account amongſt the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. <hi>Severus</hi> admiring him for his Size, match'd him, being a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> not with the Soldiers, but ſome of the ſtouteſt Slaves and Drudges of the Camp; of whom he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſixteen one after another: for which he received as many <hi>Praemiums,</hi> proportionable to the meanneſs of the Combat, that is, they were of an inferiour Value to thoſe that were appointed for the Soldiers; and withal he was ordered to be taken into the Army. Another day as <hi>Severus</hi> went to the Camp, he obſerved <hi>Maximin</hi> in the Crowd Dancing and Leaping after the <hi>Barbarian</hi> way. <hi>Severus</hi> ordered a Tribune to Reform him, according to the Diſcipline of the <hi>Romans. Maximin</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Emperor had ſpoken of him, and being proud to be taken Notice of, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the ſide of the Emperors Horſe, and began to Run by him as he Rid. <hi>Severus,</hi> to try his Running, gave a looſe to his Horſe, and took ſeveral Rounds, till fatigued by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Age, and ſeeing <hi>Maximin</hi> ſtill keep cloſe by him, <hi>You Thracian,</hi> ſays he to him, <hi>can you Wreſtle as well as you Run? Sir,</hi> ſays <hi>Maximin, as much as you pleaſe.</hi> After this <hi>Severus</hi> diſmounted, and ordered ſome of the freſheſt and the ſtrongeſt Soldiers to be pickt out, to Wreſtle with him: <hi>Maximin</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw ſeven of theſe one after another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Breathing; for which he received the before mention'd Prizes in Silver, and <hi>Severus</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52508:252"/> beſides, did him the particular Honour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent<note place="margin">His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</note> him with a Collar of Gold, and he placed him in his <hi>Guards du Corps,</hi> becauſe he ſhould be always by him. This made <hi>Maximin</hi> a Remarkable Man, and acquired him a great Eſteem. The Tribunes loved him. His Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Soldiers admired him. He obtained of the Emperor any thing that he deſired; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him above the reſt of the Soldiers, though he was as yet a Youth. He excelled all in the Heighth and Vaſtneſs of his Body, with which he had at the ſame time a good Meen; and in the largeneſs of his Eyes, which were no leſs Bright and Handſome. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Maximin</hi> often drank Eight <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors</hi> of Wine in a day; and eat either Forty, or as <hi>Aelius Cardus</hi> ſays, Sixty pound of Fleſh. But he kept himſelf wholly from Herbs, and rarely eat any Cold Meats, unleſs it was, when he was under a neceſſity of drinking. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten preſerved his Sweat, and received it into Cups, or a little Veſſel for the purpoſe; ſo that he could ſhew you, two or three Quarts of his Sweat at a time.</p>
                     <p>Under the Reign of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus,</hi> he long Commanded as a Centurion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted Parties, and ſerved ſeveral other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of the Army. He hated the ſucceeding Reign of <hi>Opilius Macrinus;</hi> becauſe that Prince had been the Author of the Murder of <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Caracallus,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Severus,</hi> who was <hi>Maximin</hi>'s firſt Maſter. In this Reign therefore he quitted the Army, and bought himſelf an Eſtate in a Village of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania,</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52508:252"/> where he was born. There he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually entertain'd a Commerce with the <hi>Goths.</hi> The <hi>Goths</hi> loved him entirely, as if he was their own Fellow-Citizen: The <hi>Alans</hi> did the ſame, and brought him, whenever they approached to the Banks of the River, Preſents, which he returned in others to them again. But when <hi>Opilius Macrinus,</hi> together with his Son, was killed, and <hi>Maximin</hi> found that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was preferred to the Empire, as the Reputed Son of <hi>Antoninus Caracallus, Maximin,</hi> who was then of a mature Age, waited upon him with a Complement, That as he had had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the good Opinion of his Grandfather the Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> ſo he wiſh'd, he might be ſo happy as to have his.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> rallied with him in his Impure way, and ſaid, <hi>Maximin, Thou haſt Tyred thy</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus</note> 
                        <hi>Sixteen or Twenty, or ſometimes Thirty Luſty Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers I hear, in Playing and Wreſtling with them; How many Times canſt thou Perform with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; I warrant thee, thou canſt do that Thirty times too. Maximin,</hi> not ſatisfied with this ſort of Reception, would have retired himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country again, but that the Friends of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> detained him, and thought it a Scandal to let the Braveſt Man of the Age go off ſo, who was another <hi>Hercules,</hi> another <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> another <hi>Ajax,</hi> as the People called him. They did him the Honour to Create him a Tribune; but yet he never attended upon the Perſon of that moſt Impure Prince, nor came to ſalute him in all the three Years of his Reign; but was always either moving from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52508:253"/> place to place upon one ſpecious Occaſion or other, or he pretended himſelf Sick, that he could not wait upon the Court.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was killed, and that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> had an Account, that <hi>Alexander Severus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>And by</hi> Alexander Severus.</note> the Son of <hi>Mammaea,</hi> was advanced to the Empire, he came to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the New Prince with all the Joy and all the Satisfaction in the World. Inſomuch that he ſpoke to the Senate of him in theſe Words: <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Maximin <hi>the Tribune is come to me, who could not reconcile himſelf to the Service of that Impure Beaſt my Predeceſſor. I have given him a Robe Embroidered with Studs of Gold. His Merit recommanded him to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperor</hi> Septimius Severus, <hi>and you know the Reputation that he hath attained to ſince.</hi> Immediately he gave the Command of the Fourth Legion, which was one that himſelf had raiſed, and conſiſted all of young Soldiers; and at the ſame time he expreſſed himſelf thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My very dear and entirely Beloved</hi> Maximin, <hi>I have not thought fit to Trouble you with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Legion of Old Soldiers for this reaſon; becauſe I queſtion, whether the Vices of ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed in them under the Command of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are capable of your Amendment. I give you a Legion of Novices, whom you may bring up your ſelf to your own hand. Mould them, Form them as you pleaſe. It will be a great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the State and to me, to teach them their Arms ſo, that they may produce many</hi> Maximins, <hi>that is, many ſuch good Soldiers as you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52508:253"/>
                     <p>No ſooner had <hi>Maximin</hi> received this Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he began to Exerciſe them. Every fifth Day he did the ſame; and repreſented with them Fights and the Taking of Towns. He inſpected their Swords, Javelins, Targets, Helmets, Cloaths, and all their Arms and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipages perpetually, to their very Shooes. He was as a Father to them. And when ſome of the other Tribunes pretended to blame him, ſaying; <hi>Why ſhould you take ſo much Pains, who are in a Poſt to be preferred to be a General when you pleaſe?</hi> Says he, <hi>The Greater I ever am, the more Pains I ſhall take ſtill.</hi> He Wreſtled with his Men himſelf, and Threw half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen<note place="margin">His mighty Strength.</note> or more of them one after another, though perhaps he was an Old Man grown to them then: This created him much Envy. One Tribune particularly, who was Prouder and more Angry than the reſt, and of a large Size, and known Gallantry, ſaid to him; <hi>What great Matter is it for a Tribune to Throw his own Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers?</hi> Says <hi>Maximin, Shall you and I try then our Strength together?</hi> The other conſented: But <hi>Maximin</hi> gave him ſuch a Thruſt with his open Hand on his Breaſt as he came, that he fell flat upon his Back; and <hi>Maximin</hi> cryed, <hi>Come on any other Tribune that will. Aelius Cordus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Maximin</hi> was ſuch a Vaſt Man, that he was Eight Foot and almoſt a half High. His Hand ſo big, that his Wife's Bracelet for her Arm made him but a Ring for his Thumb. Theſe other things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported of him, That he could draw a Chariot after him by his Arms, and move a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52508:254"/> loaded Litter himſelf; That if he gave a Horſe a Blow on the Mouth with his Fiſt, he ſtruck out his Teeth; and if he Kicked him, he broke his Legs. Hard Stones he ſqueezed into pieces betwixt his Fingers: The younger Trees he tore up. Some have call'd him a ſecond <hi>Milo,</hi> a <hi>Hercules,</hi> and an <hi>Antaeus,</hi> for his Strength and Vaſtneſs.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things therefore rendring him ſo<note place="margin">He is made a General.</note> Conſpicuous, the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who was a great Judge of Perſons of Merit, preferred him to the General Command of his Army, with the univerſal Satisfaction of all the Tribunes, Officers, and Men. This was afterwards Fatal to that Prince. All that Army which was grown in a manner unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, under the Reign of <hi>Heliogabalus, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imin</hi> brought to be Diſciplined to his own mind. So that when <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> was in <hi>Gallia,</hi> Encamped not far from ſome Town there, whether it was that <hi>Maximin</hi> ſet the Soldiers upon him, as ſome ſay; or whether it was, the diſaffected Tribunes amongſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> Disbanded (for he Disbanded whole Legions there, with the ſame ſeverity as before he had done in the <hi>Eaſt</hi>) I know not; but a Party of Soldiers broke in on a ſudden upon him, and killed both him and his Mother; and <hi>Maximin</hi> was immediately proclaimed Emperor. The Age of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who was otherwiſe an excellent Prince, was one thing that might be liable to create in ſome meaſure a Contempt of him.</p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52508:254"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximin,</hi> who never was any thing but a<note place="margin">He is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd Emperor.</note> Soldier, and had not yet been a Senator, was Proclaimed Emperor by the Army, without any Decree of the Senate; and his Son (of whom hereafter) was given him to be his Colleague. Now <hi>Maximin</hi> was always ſo Wiſe, that he not only Commanded his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by his Authority, but he made them love him very much, by the Rewards and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that he gave them. He never injured them in their Pay. He never Muſtered Smiths or any ſort of Artiſans as others do in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He often took them to Hunt with him. But together with theſe Vertues, he was ſo Cruel, that he was called by all the Names of<note place="margin">His Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> a <hi>Cyclops,</hi> a <hi>Buſyris,</hi> a <hi>Sciron,</hi> a <hi>Phalaris,</hi> a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> and a <hi>Gyges.</hi> The Senate dreaded him ſo, that their Wives and Children made Prayers in the Temples, in publick and in private, that he might never ſee the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> They had heard, how in his method of Reforming the Diſcipline of the Army, ſome he Crucified, ſome he ſtuffed into the Bodies of Beaſts new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed, ſome he caſt alive to Wild Beaſts, ſome he Cudgel'd to death, and all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction of the Quality of the Perſon. They feared, he would pretend to Reform the State the ſame way: which yet is not a Courſe for a Prince to take, who deſigns to be Loved. But it was <hi>Maximin</hi>'s Perſuaſion, that the Empire was not to be held by him without Cruelty. He ſuſpected, that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility would contemn his Low and <hi>Barbarian</hi> Birth. He remembred, that he had been
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52508:255"/> ſlighted at <hi>Rome</hi> formerly, even by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſome of the Nobility, who would not admit him to ſee them. And as the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of an Ignoble Mind is of ſtrange Effect, he thought, that as many as were privy to his Baſe Original, would uſe him accordingly ſtill. All ſuch therefore he Killed, and amongſt thoſe, ſome that had been his Friends, and had given him often ſeveral things in Charity and Pity to the poor Condition he was in, at his firſt coming to <hi>Rome.</hi> Never was any thing on the Earth crueller than he. He thought himſelf almoſt Immortal; he ſcarce thought he could be Killed; he confided ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Strength and the Magnitude of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and his Parts. But, as an Epigram ſaid, which was made upon him in relation to this, <hi>He that cannot be killed by one, is to be killed by many; As Great as an Elephant is, an Elephant is to be Killed; As Strong as a Lion is, a Lion is to be Killed; As Strong as a Tyger is, a Tyger is to be Killed; So he that does not fear to be killed by One Man, let him have a care however of a Number.</hi> This Epigram was repeated by a Mimick in his preſence from the Stage. But being repeated in Greek, which was a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which he who was a <hi>Thracian</hi> and a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian</hi> did not underſtand, and not being told the true meaning of it, it paſs'd upon him. He retained no Perſons of the Nobility about him. He Reigned like another <hi>Spartacus</hi> or an <hi>Athenion,</hi> with a Court, as it were of Mobb. All the Miniſters of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> he put to Death after ſeveral ways. He envied the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52508:255"/> Deſigns of that Prince, and his Diſpoſition of things; and the Suſpicion which he had of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who had ſerved or loved him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked <hi>Maximin</hi> to be more and more Cruel.</p>
                     <p>This being his way, to Live and Reign like a Fury, he was made yet far more Cruel and Inhumane by a Conſpiracy againſt him of one<note place="margin">A Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him</note> 
                        <hi>Magnus</hi> a Conſul, who with a number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Centurions, had laid a deſign to Kill him, and to Tranſlate the Empire upon himſelf. The Manner that they pretended to take to do it was this: <hi>Maximin</hi> having made a Bridge to paſs the River into <hi>Germany,</hi> the Conſpirators who were to accompany him, after he was Landed, were to break the Bridge and Kill him, and cry, he was killed by an Ambuſcade of the Enemy. In the mean time <hi>Magnus</hi> ſhould take upon him the Empire. It is true, <hi>Maximin,</hi> as he perfectly underſtood the matter of War, was fond of that War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Germans:</hi> He knew his being a good Soldier was the occaſion that he was made Emperor; and he was ambitious to keep up the Reputation which he had, and to outſhine particularly the Glory of the late Prince, whom he had Murdered. He kept his Men daily to their Exerciſes, when he was Emperor, as he did when he was a Tribune: He put himſelf in Arms at the Head of them, and with his Hand and the movements of his Body, taught them a great many things. But whether or no, that Plot of <hi>Magnus</hi> to Kill him, was real, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was a Fiction of <hi>Maximin</hi>'s own, for an opportunity to increaſe the matter of his

He put them all to Death without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, without Accuſer appearing againſt them, without Tryal, without any Defence of themſelves; and all their Eſtates he Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> had taken into his Army a Body of Auxiliaries of <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Meſopotamians,</hi> and others out of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who being excellent Archers, he judged would be of great Uſe in the War againſt the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Theſe Archers upon the Death of that<note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> Prince, whom they very much loved, Revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Maximin,</hi> becauſe they would not be perſuaded, but that <hi>Maximin</hi> had been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Murder. They ſet up <hi>Titus Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> who was a Captain of their own, to be their General and their Emperor. They put upon him the Purple, and adorned him with all the State of a Perſon in ſuch a Place. <hi>Titus</hi> complyed with them in it, but it was againſt his Will: But being afterwards killed in his Tent as he lay aſleep by one of his own Men called <hi>Macedon,</hi> who envied him only becauſe he was Preferred before him, and his Head being brought to <hi>Maximin,</hi> this Defection ceaſed; and <hi>Maximin</hi> at firſt gave Thanks to <hi>Macedon</hi> for the Service which he had done him; but afterwards he hated him as a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and put him to Death. Still this Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerved to increaſe the Tyranny of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min;</hi> as a Beaſt when he is Wounded, frets
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52508:256"/> and rages ſo much the more for it. He paſs'd into <hi>Germany</hi> with all his Army: The <hi>Moors, Parthians, Meſopotamians,</hi> and all thoſe that <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> had muſtered out of the Countries of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> marched with him; For being Light, and the beſt Archers, none were of greater Uſe againſt the <hi>Germans</hi> than they. The Preparations of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> for this War had been great: But yet <hi>Maximin</hi> added ſuch things to them, as rendred them much more Puiſſant and more Formidable.</p>
                     <p>He paſſed the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and entring into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>

He drove their Cattel, killed great numbers of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> took innumerable others Priſoners, and made his Army Rich with Plunder. He had certainly reduced all the Country of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> under the Obedience of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but that the <hi>Germans</hi> betook themſelves to Swim the Rivers and the Lakes, and to ſeek their ſhelter in the Woods. He did a great deal with his own Hand: He had indeed been cut off in a Lake, in which his Horſe ſtuck faſt, and the Enemy ſurrounded him, but that his Men came timely up to his Reſcue. It was a piece of his <hi>Barbarian</hi> Temerity to think, that an Emperor ought always to Fight with his own Hand. He maintain'd a ſort of a Naval Fight in the Lake, and killed ſeveral. So <hi>Germany</hi> being conquer'd, he wrote an Account of it to the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:</p>

                        <hi>It is impoſſible, Fathers of the Senate, to expreſs all that we have done: For 400 Miles about we have Burnt the Villages of the</hi> Germans, <hi>driven away their Cattel, taken Priſoners, and ſlain all that oppoſed us. We maintained a Fight in a Lake. We had penetrated their Woods, but that the depth of their Lakes permitted us no paſſage over to them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Together with this, he ordered Pictures of this War, as it was, to be drawn and laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Senate, that they might read, as well as hear his Exploits. Which Pictures after his death the Senate commanded to be taken down and burnt. Indeed he hated the Senate in his heart, becauſe he imagined that they deſpiſed him. In all his other Engagements, which were many, he came off always Conqueror, and took great Booties, and many Priſoners. He ſays in another Letter which he ſent to the Senate, thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In ſo ſhort a time, Fathers of the Senate, I have Fought more Battels than any of the Antients ever did.

And not the <hi>Romans</hi> only, but the Forces that were in <hi>Africa;</hi> becauſe he was ſo Cruel upon the Soldiers, Conſpired in their Opinions with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and made a great and a ſudden Revolt, in which they ſet up <hi>Gordianus</hi> to be Emperor, who was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul of <hi>Africa,</hi> and a Perſon of much Worth, in this manner:</p>
                     <p>There was a Receiver of the Exchequer in <hi>Libya,</hi> who in favour of <hi>Maximin,</hi> to raiſe him the more Money, grievouſly Exacted upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body; till the People of the Country, and ſome of the Soldiers fell upon him and killed him, in ſpight of the Oppoſition of his Party which defended him, and which ſtood up for the Honour and the Intereſts of <hi>Maximin.</hi> The Proconſul of <hi>Africa</hi> at this time, was <hi>Gordianus;</hi> a Man advanced in Years, but of very great Worth and Virtue, which made him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52508:258"/> and one who had been put into that Command by the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> with the Concurrence of the Senate.

                        </note> Emperor. He threw himſelf upon the ground, and refuſed it with all the Averſion and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs in the World.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fathers of the Senate, It was altogether againſt my Will, that the People of this Country, and the Army to whom the preſervation of it is committed, have called me to the Empire. But with an eye to you, I content my ſelf to ſuſtain that Neceſſity. It is for you to conſider what you will do. For till I receive the Judgment of the Senate, I ſhall be uncertain and full of doubt, what courſe to take.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as this Letter was read, the Senate Anſwered it in theſe Acclamations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Gods preſerve our</hi> Auguſtus, <hi>and our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> Gordianus. <hi>The Gods give a happy Reign to your Majeſty, who hath Delivered us. May your Majeſty, who is our Deliverer, Reign in ſafety. The State is ſee in you. We give you all poſſible Thanks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Conſul moved the Senate, and ſaid: <hi>Fathers of the Senate, what is your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to the</hi> Maximins? They cryed, <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Enemies.</hi> The Conſul moved the Senate again, and ſaid, <hi>What is your Judgment as to the Friends and Adherents of</hi> Maximin? They cryed, <hi>Enemies, Enemies! whoever kills them, ſhall receive a Praemium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then theſe Acclamations followed: <hi>Let the Enemy of the Senate be Crucified. Let the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Senate in all Parts be deſtroyed. Let the Enemies of the Senate be burnt Alive. The Gods ſave our two Emperors the</hi> Gordiani! <hi>May you both Live; May you both Reign together in Happineſs!

                           <hi>Rage of</hi> Maximin <hi>upon the News.</hi>
                        </note> brought to <hi>Maximin,</hi> he, who was naturally fierce, broke out into ſuch a rage and paſſion, you would think him more like a Lion than a Man. He beat himſelf againſt the Wall, and ſometimes threw himſelf upon the ground. He roared extravagantly, and drew his Sword, as if he would kill the Senate: he tore in pieces his Royal Cloaths, and ſtruck at ſuch as were next him; and if his own Son had not retired out of his way, they ſay, he would have pull'd out his Eyes. The reaſon of his Paſſion againſt his Son was this: He had ordered him at their firſt entrance to the Empire, to go and live at <hi>Rome;</hi> which his Son out of his too great love to his Father, having neglected, <hi>Maximin</hi> thought, that if but his Son had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senate would never have dared to attempt this Revolt. Whilſt he was in this extream Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Friends carried him to his Bed. The next day, becauſe he could not otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf, nor lay aſide the thoughts of his Reſentments, they ſet him to drown them in Wine; which he did. The day after he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a Council of his Friends, to conſider what was beſt to be done. They ſaid little; ſome of them in their hearts applauded the Act of the Senate. From this Council, he went to his Army; whom he harangued in a Speech, which was full of Paſſion againſt <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52508:260"/> and the <hi>Africans</hi> that had ſet him up, and eſpecially againſt the Senate; and then he exhorts them to Revenge their common Injuries. The Speech was this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Fellow-Soldiers, I am to tell you a Thing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Speech to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> 
                        <hi>which you will not think to be any News to you, you know the Country ſo well, which is this; The</hi> Africans <hi>have revolted and broken their Faith with me. I would fain know, when did they ever keep it with any?</hi> Gordianus <hi>a feeble Old Man, with one Foot in the Grave, hath taken upon him the Empire. And our Holy Fathers of the Senate, have made his Son Emperor, with him. Thoſe moſt Holy Fathers of the Senate! who, as they once Murdered the Thrice Noble</hi> Julius Caeſar, <hi>ſo now they have adjudged me an Enemy, at the ſame time that I am Fighting for them, and Conquering for them. Nor is it Me only, whom they have adjudged ſo, but You and all that are with me. Therefore if you are Men, and Men of Bravery and Courage, let us march againſt the Senate and againſt the</hi> Africans, <hi>and you ſhall have all their Eſtates amongſt you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, he gave them a great Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and began to March them towards <hi>Rome.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Gordianus</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> having diſplaced <hi>Capellianus</hi> from the Government of the Province of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> becauſe he was a Friend of <hi>Maximin, Capellianus</hi> had put himſelf upon his defence, and gathered together a Body of Men againſt him. <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Father ſent his Son <hi>Gordianus</hi> to meet and Fight <hi>Capellianus.</hi> They Engaged one another with great obſtinacy. <hi>Gordianus</hi> was killed and loſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52508:260"/> the Battle: which his Father much lamenting,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Young</hi> Gordia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>ſlain.</hi>
                        </note> and knowing that <hi>Maximin</hi> was very ſtrong, and that on the contrary the <hi>Africans</hi> were a People not ſufficient for him to truſt to, and<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Old</hi> Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus <hi>kills him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                        </note> full of Treachery, he, rather than to fall into the hands of <hi>Maximin,</hi> put an end to his own days, and Strangled himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Capellianus</hi> made good uſe of this Victory. He ſlew and proſcribed all he found of the Party of <hi>Gordianus;</hi> he ſpared none, as if he acted with the very Soul of <hi>Maximin</hi> in him. He ſubverted whole Cities, plundered the Temples, diſtributed the Booty of the Temples amongſt his Soldiers. He cut in pieces Poor and Rich together; ingratiating himſelf much with the Soldiers, that in caſe <hi>Maximin</hi> ſhould dye, himſelf might have a fair hit for the Empire.</p>
                     <p>When the News of this was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senate being more in fear than ever upon it, of the Cruelty of <hi>Maximin,</hi> which upon ſo much provocation given, he had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as much as it was his Nature, to exert, they ſet up <hi>Pupienus Maximus</hi> and <hi>Clodius Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus</hi> to be Emperors, together with <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Third, a Youth, who was the Grandſon of <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Firſt. So they had three Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors to ſupport them againſt <hi>Maximin,</hi> at once. The firſt had been the Governour of the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> had paſſed through many high Offices with reputation, and was one of great Worth and Note, but not of Birth. As he was of the ſeverer Life, ſo was he the moſt Prudent and moſt Valorous of all the three:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52508:261"/> and therefore both the Senate and <hi>Balbinus,</hi> his Brother, who was a more eaſie Man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the War againſt <hi>Maximin</hi> to him. He went, <hi>Balbinus</hi> tarried at <hi>Rome;</hi> where there aroſe inteſtine Broils and domeſtick Seditions in a manner that was more violent, than <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus</hi> was able to ſuppreſs; till the Soldiers of the Guards cut in pieces ſeveral of the People. <hi>Gallicanus</hi> and <hi>Mecaenas</hi> were particularly killed in this Fray, and a great part of the City was burnt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximin</hi> was well refreſhed, to hear of the death of <hi>Gordianus</hi> and his Son, and of the Victory of <hi>Capellianus.</hi> But when again he received the further News of the Act of the Senate for the conſtituting <hi>Maximus, Balbinus,</hi> and <hi>Gordianus</hi> Emperors, he concluded that the Hatred of the Senate to him was Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and that they did all really make him a publick Enemy; ſo he was the more violent to advance his Expedition into <hi>Italy:</hi> He croſſed the <hi>Alps,</hi> and came to <hi>Hemona,</hi> a City which anciently ſtood in the way to <hi>Aquileia.</hi> Some ſay he found this City empty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, which he was pleaſed to ſee, as if it was, that they had all ceded to the Power of his Arm. However it was, when he came to Encamp on the Plain, he could not find Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to recruit his Army. For the People of the Country, according to the Advices that were ſent them, had every where driven their Cattel and their Proviſions, and retired within the Town, on purpoſe that <hi>Maximin</hi> and his Army ſhould periſh for want of Proviſions.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52508:261"/> This incenſed his Army againſt him. They did not think to be ſtarved in <hi>Italy,</hi> but to be mightily refreſhed after their Journey over the <hi>Alps.</hi> They began firſt to murmur within themſelves, then to ſpeak ſome things openly, which he pretending to revenge upon them, they Mutined ſtill more; but deferred to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, till a convenient time, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelf not long after. He advanced to the City of <hi>Aquileia;</hi> who ſhut their Gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Maximus <hi>beſieges</hi> Aquielia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> him, and were reſolved to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, under the Conduct of <hi>Menophilus</hi> and <hi>Criſpinus,</hi> two Officers of the Order of the Conſuls, who were ſent to them from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. He offered them Propoſitions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Surrender: To which the People had well nigh conſented, but that <hi>Menophilus</hi> and his Partner withſtood them, and ſaid, That they were aſſured of Conquering <hi>Maximin;</hi> becauſe <hi>Apollo,</hi> the Tutelar God of the Place, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered as much to them by his Soothſayers. Hence the Party of <hi>Maximin,</hi> after they were defeated, took occaſion to ſay, That it was <hi>Apollo</hi> who fought againſt them; and the Victory which was obtained, was not a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Maximus,</hi> nor of the Senate, but it was a Victory of the Gods. At leaſt they pretended to ſay this for themſelves, becauſe they were aſhamed indeed, that ſo weak and ſo ill-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Place had held it out againſt ſo ſtrong an Army. <hi>Maximin</hi> paſſed the River upon a Bridge of Boats, and began to lay cloſe Siege to it. This Service was hot on both ſides. <hi>Maximin</hi> and his Son went round the Walls,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52508:262"/> as near as poſſible, and ſometimes encouraged on their Men, ſometimes made Overtures to thoſe in the Town. But all did them no great good. Both his Son and he had many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches thrown upon them, becauſe of the Beauty of the one, and the Cruelty of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At length thinking that it was the Lazineſs of his Officers, which was the cauſe that the Siege was protracted, he put ſome of thoſe to death, at a time when he the leaſt ſhould have done it; becauſe it made his Army the more diſſatisfied with him. In the mean time his Army was in a great want of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For the Senate had ſent Orders to all the Provinces, and to the Governours of the Ports, that they ſhould ſuffer no Convoys to paſs to him: They had alſo ſent Praetors and Quaeſtors to all Towns to keep ſtrong Guards, and to diſpoſe all manner of things, to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. So that he who was the Beſieger, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the diſtreſs of Perſons beſieged. And it was ſaid, that all the World conſpired to hate him. His Soldiers ſeeing this, and fearing what might be the Conſequences of it, whoſe Wives and Children were aſſembled together upon the Mountain <hi>Albano</hi> not far off, they took their opportunity, when they were at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from Action, and whilſt <hi>Maximin</hi> and his<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Both the</hi> Maximins <hi>ſlain.</hi>
                        </note> Son were repoſed in their Tent about Noon, to fall upon them, and kill them. Their Heads they fix'd upon Spears, and ſhew'd them to the Garriſon of <hi>Aquileia.</hi> The Statues and Images that were of <hi>Maximin</hi> in the Camp, were immediately defaced and taken down;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52508:262"/> the Captain of the Guards to him killed, with others of his particular Friends, and the Heads of both the Father and the Son were ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was the End of the two <hi>Maximins.</hi> An End, juſt upon the Father, who deſerved it for his Cruelty, as much as it was ſevere upon the Son, who was a good Prince. All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces received the News with great joy. But the Barbarians regreted his loſs. His Army ſubmitted: whereof ſuch as were declared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemies, were put to death; the reſt were received by the Town of <hi>Aquileia:</hi> A great Convoy of Proviſions was ſent to them into their Camp, which was almoſt ſtarving, and the next day they all took the Oath of Fidelity to <hi>Maximus, Balbinus,</hi> and <hi>Gordianus;</hi> Adored<note place="margin">Three new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</note> before their Images, and acknowledged the two late <hi>Gordiani</hi> as Gods, who had loſt their Lives in the Cauſe againſt <hi>Maximin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not eaſie to expreſs the great Joy that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, as the Head of <hi>Maximin</hi> was carried through the Country of <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> Every body was glad to run to meet it. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Maximus</hi> was then at <hi>Ravenna;</hi> where he had raiſed himſelf ſome Auxiliary Troops of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and was making Preparations for the War. But as ſoon as he received the News, that the <hi>Maximins</hi> were both killed, and that their Army had yielded, and ſworn Fidelity to him and his Colleagues, he diſmiſſed thoſe Troops, and immediately writ Letters of the Victory to <hi>Rome:</hi> where it produced ſuch an Univerſal Joy, that every body repaired to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52508:263"/> Altars, Temples, the Chappels and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Houſes, to give Thanks unto the Gods for it. The Emperor <hi>Balbinus,</hi> who was by nature a Timerous Man, and who trembled when he but heard the Name of <hi>Maximin,</hi> offered a Sacrifice of an hundred Beaſts, and ordered the ſame to be repeated through all the Cities of <hi>Italy.</hi> Then <hi>Maximus</hi> returned to <hi>Rome:</hi> Coming to the Senate, he Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated to them the Succeſs of his Expedition, and made a Speech. After which he, <hi>Balbinus,</hi> and <hi>Gordianus,</hi> went together to the Court, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all the uſual Acclamations of Joy and Victory.</p>
                     <p>It is fit to know, what a Decree the Senate paſſed upon this, and what a Day it was with the People at <hi>Rome,</hi> when the News arrived of the Death of <hi>Maximin.</hi> The Expreſs ſent with it from <hi>Aquileia,</hi> took his way by <hi>Ravenna</hi> to deliver it firſt to the Emperor <hi>Maximus,</hi> and yet he made ſuch haſte by change of Horſes, that he reached <hi>Rome</hi> in four days, which was never known done before. The two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors <hi>Balbinus</hi> and <hi>Gordianus,</hi> with all the People, were then aſſembled in the Theatre, at the Publick Divertiſements. Immediately as the Expreſs came into the Theatre, before he could have the time to ſay any thing, all the People cryed out with great Joy, <hi>Maximin</hi> is Killed; which was a grateful Hearing to the Emperors. So the Company roſe, and every one went ſtrait to the Temples and the Chappels, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn their Thanks to the Gods. From thence the Emperors went to the Senate, which Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52508:263"/> upon this Occaſion, as likewiſe did the People; and after the Emperor <hi>Balbinus</hi> had read to the Senate the Letter which was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Maximus,</hi> the Senate paſſed this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as follows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Gods Purſue the Enemies of the People of</hi> Rome. <hi>We return our Thanks to thee for the ſame, O moſt Excellent</hi> Jupiter, <hi>and to Thee, O Holy</hi> Apollo! <hi>We Thank the Emperor</hi> Maximus. <hi>We Thank Your Majeſties here preſent,</hi> Balbinus <hi>and</hi> Gordianus. <hi>We Decree Temples to the Honour of the Emperors the</hi> Gordiani, <hi>deceaſed. The Name of</hi> Maximin, <hi>as it hath already been eraſed out of the Publick Monuments, ſo now let it be eraſed out of our Thoughts, and be forgotten for ever: Let the Head of the Publick Enemy be thrown into the River, and no Man Bury his Body. He that threatned the Senate with Death and Bonds, is Killed as he deſerved. We give our Thanks for it to your moſt Sacred Majeſties,</hi> Maximus, Balbinus <hi>and</hi> Gordianus. <hi>The Gods Preſerve you. We all wiſh you Victory over your Enemies. We all deſire the Return and Preſence of</hi> Maximus. <hi>The Gods Save Your Majesty</hi> Balbinus. <hi>Your Majeſties will be pleaſed to be the Conſuls this Year.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Cupidius Celerimus</hi> ſaid thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having Eraſed the Name of the</hi> Maximins, <hi>and Deified the Emperors the</hi> Gordiani, <hi>we on the other hand Decree Triumphal Statues, with Elephants, to our preſent Princes</hi> Maximus, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,

                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Senate Adjourn'd. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors retired to the Palaces, and Publick Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were appointed throughout all the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>MAXIMIN</hi> the Second, or the Younger, and the Son of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, was a Youth of that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Beauty, that generally the Ladies of Wit were in Love with him: ſome of them even wiſhed themſeves a part in his Careſſes, and to have Children by him. He
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52508:265"/> was ſo Tall, that had he lived, it is probable, he would have reach'd the heighth of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But he dyed in the Flower of his Youth, in his one and twentieth Year, or, as ſome ſay, in his eighteenth. He had learn'd the<note place="margin">His Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Maſters.</note> Greek and Latin Languages to a Perfection. In the Greek his Maſter was <hi>Fabilius,</hi> who hath ſeveral Epigrams in the Greek, yet extant; and particularly ſome that he made upon the Picture of his Scholar. In the Latin he had the Grammarian <hi>Philemon, Modeſtinus</hi> the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and <hi>Titianus</hi> the Orator. The Father of which laſt was he, who hath written a Choro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy of the Provinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and was called the <hi>Ape of his Age;</hi> becauſe he Imitated all things. He had a Greek Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ian called <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who was Famous in his time. <hi>Junia Fadilla,</hi> a Daughter of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Princes, the <hi>Antonini,</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to him; who afterwards was Married to <hi>Toxotius,</hi> a Senator of the ſame Family, who dyed after his Praetorſhip, and hath written ſome Poems, which we have at this day. The Preſents which were given to her by <hi>Maximin</hi> when he Contracted her, are particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by <hi>Aelius Cordus.</hi> A Locket of nine great Pearls, a Head ſet with eleven Emeralds, a Bracelet of four Jacynths, Garments of Cloth of Gold, and all the Ornaments of Princely Attire, which were fit for a New Spouſe.</p>
                     <p>As this <hi>Maximin</hi> was very Beautiful, ſo he carried a Pride to the higheſt degree: he kept himſelf Sitting, when his Father, as Cruel as he was, many times roſe to Perſons of Honour,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52508:265"/> that came to wait upon him. He was of a gay Humour, Drank little, but loved good Eating, eſpecially of the wild Creatures of the Field; the Wild Boar, Duck, Crane, and the like, were his conſtant Diſhes. Thoſe of the Party of the Emperors <hi>Maximus, Balbinus,</hi> and <hi>Gordianus,</hi> and particularly the Senators, were willing to ſlander him becauſe of his great Beauty: Pretending, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that ſo charming a Gift of the Gods could be kept uncorrupt. So alſo, when he went about the Walls of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with his Father, to perſuade that City to a Surrender. All that they pretended to object againſt him, was, the matter of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,</hi> becauſe of his tempting Beauty, which however was very far from him. He was ſo <hi>Proper</hi> in his Cloaths, that no Lady in the World could be more. He was extreamly Obſequious to ſuch as were of his Father's Friends; that is, ſo far as to give them what was in his power, and make them Largeſſes. But when they paid their Reverences to him, he received them in a manner, which was again as high. He gave them his Hand to kiſs; he ſuffered them to kiſs his Knees, and ſometimes his Feet: which his Father would never do; who ſaid, <hi>The Gods forbid, that any free-born Man ſhould lay his Lips to my Feet.</hi> Having mention'd his Father, I deſire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert one pleaſant Paſſage of him. He was, as I have obſerved before in his Life, Eight Foot and almoſt a half high. Therefore his Shoe, or Royal Buskin, was given by ſome,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52508:266"/> to be ſeen publickly, in a Religious Houſe in a Grove, which is betwixt the City <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and a place called <hi>Arzia:</hi> which Shoe, it is certain, is bigger by a Foot, than the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of any other Man: And hence it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Proverb to ſay of one, who is of an extraordinary Height, without much Wit, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liga Maximini.</hi> i. e. <hi>He is the Print of</hi> Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; <hi>He treads in his Shoe.</hi> But I return to ſpeak of the Son.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> in a Letter to his Mother <hi>Mammaea,</hi> appears to have had ſome thoughts of Matching this <hi>Maximin</hi> to his own Siſter <hi>Theoclia.</hi> The Letter was this.</p>

                              <hi>I</hi> Would propoſe to you, to Marry your Daughter <hi>Theoclia</hi> to the younger <hi>Maximin,</hi> did not his Father, who is a Commander in our Forces, and I aſſure you a very good one, retain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him, that ſavours of the Barbarian. I fear my Siſter, who is ſo acquainted with all the Politeneſs of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Education, will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a Father in Law of that Nature. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as for the Youth himſelf, he is Beautiful and Ingenious, and ſeems to be bred, and poliſhed to the Mode of the <hi>Grecians</hi> too: This is what I think. You may pleaſe to conſider with your ſelf, whether you will rather chooſe to have to be your Son in-Law Him, or <hi>Meſſala;</hi> who is of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Family, and a very Powerful Orator, a Learned Man, and who, if I miſtake not, would make a good Soldier, if he was put to the War.</p>

                     <p>Thus that Prince ſpeaks of the Younger <hi>Maximin.</hi> I have little more to add concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, beſides a Letter of his Father's, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Reaſons of his creating him Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in conjunction with himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have permitted my Son</hi> Maximin <hi>to be made Emperor together with me, both out of the Affection which a Father owes to a Son, and alſo becauſe the People of</hi> Rome <hi>and that Antient Senate may ſee, and ſwear, That they never had a more Beautiful Prince in their lives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Coat of Mail was all of Gold, after the Example of the <hi>Ptolomies</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> He had another all of Silver. His Shield was of Gold, enriched with Precious Stones, and his Javelin of Gold; he had Swords of Silver, and others of Gold He neglected nothing that could ſerve to aſſiſt his Beauty. His Helmets were ſet with Jewels and Emboſſed. As for what concerns his Pleaſures and his Amours, with which <hi>Aelius Cordus</hi> aſperſes him, I muſt refer the Reader, if he deſires to know them, rather to that Author, than delay my proſecution of the Lives of the other Princes that follow, in obedience to the Commands which I have received.</p>
                     <p>The Omens of his Reign were theſe: A<note place="margin">His Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew'd.</note> Serpent came and twined it ſelf about his Head as he ſlept. A Vine which he Planted, produced at the end of the Year large Grapes, of the colour of Purple, and grew to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful greatneſs. His Shield burnt by being expoſed to the Sun. His Javelin was cleft
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52508:267"/> perfectly in two from the top to the bottom, by Lightning. Which the Soothſayers remark'd as an Omen, that there ſhould ariſe Two Emperors upon the Throne of the ſame Houſe and the ſame Names, but that they ſhould not long Reign. When he was under his Maſter that taught him Grammar, a Lady his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſented him with a <hi>Homer</hi> in Purple, written in Characters of Gold. Being invited, when a little Youth, by the Emperor <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Severus</hi> to Supper, out of reſpect to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wanting the proper Veſt to ſit down in, that Prince furniſh'd him with one of his own. As a Chariot of the Emperor <hi>Antoninus Caracallus</hi> paſſed the Streets empty, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he leapt into it, and ſat himſelf down, and was with much ado, prevailed to come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>Caracallus</hi> was told of it, and withal deſired to have a care of ſuch an Auſpicious Boy. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſays <hi>Caracallus, He is a great way off of being my Succeſſor:</hi> For at that time he was too inferior for that Matter, by his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as well as his Years.</p>
                     <p>The Omens of his Death were theſe: As<note place="margin">Preſages of his Death.</note> he and his Father were on their March againſt the Emperors <hi>Maximus, Balbinus,</hi> and <hi>Gordia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a Woman met them with her Hair all diſheveled, and in a mournful figure, crying, <hi>The Maximins, the Maximins, the Maximins;</hi> as if ſhe meant to ſay, <hi>Help:</hi> But ſhe could ſpeak no more, and dyed. The ſecond days March, at Night, above a dozen Dogs ſet up a moſt miſerable Howling about his Tent, and in the morning were found dead. Five hundred
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52508:267"/> Wolves together entred into the City of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> after him: that is, the ſame, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his arrival was deſerted by all its People. But it would take me up too much time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite all the things of this nature. He who is ſo over-curious to deſire to know them, I would wiſh him only to read <hi>Aelius Cordus,</hi> who lets nothing eſcape him, even to a Fable. There are no Sepulchres of the <hi>Maximins</hi> extant. Their Bodies were thrown into a River, and their Heads burnt in the <hi>Field of Mars,</hi> with great Inſults and Rejoycings of the People.</p>
                     <p>I am not however to omit an Obſervation of <hi>Aelius Sabinus.</hi> He ſays, The Younger <hi>Maximin</hi> had a Face ſo fine and ſo well made, that after his Head was cut off, as much as it was macerated, blackened and beſineared with Gore, any one might ſee, that it was the Face of one, who had been an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary beautiful Perſon: and therefore when the Head of the Father was carried about upon a Spear, and great Joy made to ſee it; People were almoſt as much on the contrary troubled, to ſee the Head of the Son ſerved ſo too. A Greek Hiſtorian <hi>Dexippus</hi> adds, that the Son, together with the Captain of the Guards, <hi>Anolinus,</hi> was killed in the ſight of the Father. Others ſay, that after the Father had ſeen his Son killed before his eyes, he with his own Hand killed himſelf, to avoid the Treatment of his Enemies. However that is, we cannot forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the extraordinary Firmneſs of the City of <hi>Aquileia</hi> to the Intereſts of the Senate
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52508:268"/> againſt the <hi>Maximins.</hi> They maintain'd the Siege with that Obſtinacy, that when they<note place="margin">Womens Bravery.</note> wanted Strings for their Bows, they ſerved themſelves of the Womens Hair, to make Strings of: which had been ſometime done before by the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> In Memory whereof, and to the Honour of the Ladies, the Senate there Dedicated a Temple to <hi>Venus</hi> with this Title, <hi>Veneri Calvae; To</hi> Venus <hi>the Bald.</hi>

                     <byline>BY JULIUS CAPITOLINUS.</byline>
                     <head type="sub">Addreſs'd to the EMPEROR <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great.</head>
                     <p>THere were Three Princes of the Name<note place="margin">His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> of <hi>Gordianus,</hi> according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the beſt and faithfulleſt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians. The firſt of the Three, or <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Elder, was the Son of <hi>Maecius Marullus,</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> and <hi>Ulpia Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi> of the Family of the Emperor <hi>Trajan.</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52508:270"/> His Father, Grandfather, and Great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father had been Conſuls. His Wife's Father, and her Grandfather and Great Grandfather had been Conſuls. Himſelf had been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, and a very Rich and very Powerful one alſo. He lived in the Houſe which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Pompey</hi>'s the Great at <hi>Rome;</hi> and he had more Land belonging to him in the Provinces, than any one private Man beſides. After his Conſulſhip, in which the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> was his Partner, he was made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul of <hi>Africa</hi> by an Ordinance of the Senate.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt he was a Youth he writ ſeveral<note place="margin">His Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</note> Poems, now Extant: in which he offers to outdo at leaſt the Attempts of <hi>Cicero</hi> in Poetry upon the ſame Subjects: And as <hi>Virgil</hi> writ <hi>Aeneids, Statius</hi> his <hi>Achilleidos,</hi> and <hi>Homer Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liads,</hi> ſo <hi>Gordianus</hi> wrote his <hi>Antoniniados;</hi> which is a Poem in Thirty Books, and very Elegant Verſe, containing the Lives and Wars, the Publick and Private Actions of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors <hi>Antoninus the Pious,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antoninus.</hi> Afterwards, as he grew, he Declaimed in the Publick School upon Controverſies, in the preſence of the Emperors themſelves. He was very Magnificent in his Quaeſtorſhip. The Year that he was Aedile, he Entertained the People of <hi>Rome</hi> at his own expence, Twelve times, with the Publick Shews: that is, once every Month: and ſometimes he preſented five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred couple of Gladiators at a Shew, never leſs than one hundred and fifty. He had a hundred Wild Beaſts of <hi>Africa</hi> Hunted in one day; another a thouſand Bears: his ſixth day
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52508:270"/> is very Memorable. There were two hundred ſtout Stags Hunted by <hi>Britains;</hi> thirty Wild Horſes, a hundred Wild Sheep, ten Elks, a hundred <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bulls, three hundred Red <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> Oſtriches, thirty Wild Aſſes, one hundred and fifty Boars, two hundred Wild Goats, and two hundred Deer. All theſe he gave in One, which was his ſixth day, to be Hunted, taken and divided amongſt the People. There is a Painting of it yet to be ſeen, in the Houſe where he lived, of the Great <hi>Pompey:</hi> which Houſe was his, and his Father's, and his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's before him: but ſince confiſcated in the time of the Emperor <hi>Philip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In his Praetorſhip he acquitted himſelf No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. After which, he was Conſul the firſt time in conjunction with the Emperor <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Caracallus,</hi> the ſecond time in conjunction with the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus.</hi> He had two Children: a Son, who was a Conſul, and afterwards his Colleague in the Empire, who was killed in the Battel in <hi>Africa</hi> near <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> and a Daughter, called <hi>Maecia Fauſtina,</hi> who married <hi>Junius Balbus,</hi> who was alſo a Conſul. In his Conſulſhips he was the moſt Famous of all of his time: inſomuch that the Emperor <hi>Caracallus</hi> envied him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired ſometimes his Robes, ſometimes his Shews extreamly. He was the firſt Private Man of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that had a Conſular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick and Gown Embroidered with Palm-leaves and other Devices in Gold, of his own: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before, the Emperors themſelves, when Conſuls, received thoſe Robes upon ſolemn
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52508:271"/> Occaſions, either out of the Capitol where they were repoſited from time to time, or out of the Wardrobe of the Court. He gave, by the Emperor's leave, ten <hi>Sicilian</hi> Chariot-Horſes, and ten others bought out of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> to be Run in the Cirque. So that he rendred himſelf dear to the Populace, who are always affected with theſe things. <hi>Aelius Cordus</hi> ſays, that in all the Cities of <hi>Campania, Hetruria, Flaminia, Ombria,</hi> and the <hi>Picenum,</hi> he divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the People with the Sports of the Stage, and other Divertiſements, upon his own Charges, for four days together. He writ in Proſe the Praiſes of all the Princes before him of the Name of <hi>Antoninus;</hi> which Name he ſo loved, that when he entred his Son into the Publick Regiſter, before the Keeper of the Exchequer, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, it is certain, he called him, <hi>Antoninus Gordianus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After his Conſulſhip he was choſen the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Made Proconſul of</hi> Africa.</note> of <hi>Africa,</hi> with the conſent of all, who wiſhed well to the Honour of the Reign of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> in that Country. That Prince hath a Letter extant, in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns his Thanks to the Senate for making choice of ſo Deſerving a Perſon for that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You could not do any thing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Fathers of the Senate, which is more Grateful and more Pleaſing to me, than your making Choice of</hi> Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus <hi>to be the Proconſul of</hi> Africa. <hi>A Man of Honour and Gallantry, Eloquent, Juſt, Continent, Good,</hi> and ſo he goes on.</p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52508:271"/>
                     <p>This ſhews, how Great a Man he then was. When therefore he came into <hi>Africa,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Loved him, as they never did any Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul before. Some called him a <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſome a <hi>Cato,</hi> ſome a <hi>Mutius Scaevola,</hi> a <hi>Rutilius,</hi> and a <hi>C. Laelius.</hi> One day particularly, ſays <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

He loved his Son and Grandſon, his Daughter and his Grand-daughter, very entirely, and according to all the Rules of Duty: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſo much to his Wife's Father, <hi>Annius Severus,</hi> that, as if he was in the Quality of a begotten Son to him, he never preſumed to Bath in the ſame Water with him, nor before he was a Praetor, to ſit down in his preſence. When he was Conſul, he either dwelt with him always in his Houſe, or if he was at his own, he went to wait upon him, Morning or Night daily. He Drank little, and Eat leſs:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52508:272"/> was proper in his Cloaths: loved Bathing; ſo that in Summer he Bathed four or five time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some he Proſcribed, others he put to death; enterprizing many things beyond his Commiſſion, till at length the Proconſul and the Lieutenant took it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to reprove him. He nevertheleſs purſuing his Courſes, and threatning with death Perſons of the Nobility, and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular Dignity, and the <hi>Africans</hi> not being able to endure ſuch unwonted and outragious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, they firſt of all joyning ſome of the Soldiers to them, killed this Receiver. Then
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52508:272"/> they began to think, what they ſhould do next to ſecure the repoſe of the Country, and their own Lives, againſt the Party of <hi>Maximin.</hi> And it being the time that <hi>Maximin</hi> had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf odious unto all the World, one <hi>Mauricius</hi> a Captain of Note amongſt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans,</hi> and a Gentleman of good Birth, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a Party of them together upon his own Grounds, near the City <hi>Thyſdrus,</hi> and putting himſelf at the head of them, he Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued them thus.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen and Fellow-Citizens,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I thank the immortal Gods that they have given<note place="margin">Speech of <hi>Mauricius</hi> to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans.</hi>
                           </note> us this neceſſary occaſion of providing for our ſelves againſt that furious Creature <hi>Maximin.</hi> For ſince we have killed his Receiver, who was juſt ſuch another as himſelf, there is no ſafety for us, unleſs we ſet up a New Emperor. We have here a moſt Noble Perſon, who is our Proconſul, together with his Son, a Conſul, his Lieutenant. They were both of them threatned with Death by that Villain of a Receiver. If therefore you will agree with me, we will Conſtitute them our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and Array them with the Purple, and the Ornaments of the Empire, according to the Laws of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Audience anſwer'd, <hi>It is Juſt: It is Juſt. The Gods ſave the Emperor</hi> Gordianus. <hi>We Welcome His Majeſty to the Empire. Be You,</hi> Gordianus, <hi>our Emperor, and your Son Reign with you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having done this, they went in haſte to the Town of <hi>Thyſdrus,</hi> where <hi>Gordianus</hi> was. They
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52508:273"/> found the Venerable Old Gentleman repoſed upon the Bed, they told him the Reſolution that had brought them thither, and preſented him with the Purple. He threw himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, and refuſed it with all the earneſtneſs in the World. They took him up from the ground; and at laſt when there was no poſſible remedy for it, nor no other way to avoid the Peril, which was undoubtedly Great from the Party of <hi>Maximin,</hi> he ſuffered<note place="margin">He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Emperor.</note> himſelf to be proclaimed Emperor.</p>
                     <p>Now he was of the Age of Eighty Years, and had been the Governour of many Provinces in his time; and his Actions had ever recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him ſo to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he was lookt upon as one, that altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Empire. After he was Declared, his Party caſt down the Statues of <hi>Maximin,</hi> broke in pieces his Images, and by common conſent eraſed his Name out of the Publick Monuments. But upon <hi>Gordianus</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Title of <hi>Gordianus Africanus;</hi> not only becauſe he began his Reign in <hi>Africa,</hi> but upon the account of his Relation to the Family of the <hi>Scipio's.</hi> Some likewiſe ſurname both him and his Son <hi>Antonini;</hi> others <hi>Antonii.</hi> However that is, after their Elevation at the Town of <hi>Thyſdrus,</hi> they came from thence to <hi>Carthage,</hi> attended with all Princely Pomp. <hi>Gordianus,</hi> the Son, who before was the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to his Father, was appointed to be the Prince, that ſhould take the Field and be the General of the War. An Embaſſy was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched to the Senate at <hi>Rome</hi> with Letters,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52508:273"/> to give an Account of all this: which Letters were very well received by the Senate, whoſe Preſident at that time was <hi>Valerian,</hi> who was afterwards himſelf Emperor. Private Letters alſo were ſent to their Friends, who were Men of Power and Quality, to invite them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the <hi>African</hi> Revolution, and to make themſelves more their Friends by contributing their aſſiſtances to maintain it.</p>
                     <p>The Senate received the News of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Which is approv'd by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> up of two ſuch Emperors againſt <hi>Maximin</hi> with ſo great ſatisfaction, that they not only approved of what was done, but made a choice of twenty Perſons out of themſelves, amongſt whom to divide the Country of <hi>Italy,</hi> in order to defend it in the behalf of the <hi>Gordiani.</hi> Of which number was <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus,</hi> who after the death of the ſame <hi>Gordiani</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> ſucceeded to the Empire by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Senate. In the mean time, an Embaſſy from <hi>Maximin</hi> arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> with the promiſes of an Abolition of what was paſs'd to his prejudice. But the Embaſſy of the <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diani</hi> prevailed above it; from which all the Good was to be expected, that any one could deſire: It promiſed the Soldiers a great Bounty, and the People Lands and Largeſſes: It was a great deal more credited, than that of <hi>Maximin:</hi> ſo that the Senate proceeded thereupon to cut off <hi>Vitalianus,</hi> who was the Captain of the Guards to <hi>Maximin</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Vitalianus</hi> was his Creature, and had already ſhewn himſelf of ſuch another cruel Diſpoſition as his Maſter, the further effects whereof they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52508:274"/> dreaded: and it is commonly ſaid, That the Method taken to do this, was contrived for the greater privacy thus.</p>
                     <p>The Quaeſtor and ſome Soldiers with him, who were Bold Men, were ſent to <hi>Vitalianus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vitalianus <hi>ſlain.</hi>
                        </note> with Letters, pretended to be arrived for him from <hi>Maximin.</hi> The Letters were ſealed, as it were with <hi>Maximin</hi>'s Signet. Having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd them, they told him, that they had ſome things to ſpeak to him in private. He took them from the Company, into a long Gallery: where, as his Eyes were upon the Letters in his Hand, and as he was expecting to hear what they had to ſay further, they killed him; and then perſuaded the reſt of the Guards, that it was done by the Order of <hi>Maximin</hi> himſelf.</p>
                     <p>It is fit, that I ſhould give you the Decree of the Senate for Conſtituting the two <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diani</hi> Emperors, and the denouncing <hi>Maximin</hi> an Enemy. An Extraordinary Aſſembly of the Senate being called, the Conſul attended with the Praetors, Aediles and Tribunes of the People came to the Houſe. The Governour of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was not with them. He abſented himſelf for Reaſons he knew beſt: And as he was a Favourer of the <hi>Maximins,</hi> it was a kindneſs to the Cauſe of the <hi>Gordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani,</hi> that he did ſo. The Conſul opened the Seſſion with this Speech.</p>
                     <p>Fathers of the Senate,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The two <hi>Gordiani,</hi> the Father and the Son, who have both of them been Conſuls, and the one
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52508:274"/> your Proconſul of <hi>Africa,</hi> the other your Lieute<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant, are by a great Attempt of the <hi>Africans,</hi> declared Emperors there. Let us now therefore Thank the Town of <hi>Thyſdrus,</hi> and return our Thanks to our Beloved People of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that they have thus delivered us from that Cruel Beaſt, that Savage Beaſt, <hi>Maximin.</hi> What are you afraid of, Gentlemen?

Only, as when your Majeſty calls your Chief Miniſters into your Cabinet, to Conſult about Matters that are not immediately to be made known to all the World, your Miniſters are under their Oaths to ſpeak nothing of them, till ſuch time as the Buſineſs is compleated; ſo when any Publick Neceſſity in Antient Times preſs'd the State, as for Inſtance, an imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the Enemy, which obliged them either to take inferiour Meaſures perhaps, or, to make an Order which was no ſooner to be known, than done, or that they would not have their Friends nor any body to know any thing of it, then the Senate aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Private, and their Decree was Tacit: They had no Clerks, no Publick Servants, no Aſſeſſors preſent: the Senators did all, and executed the Offices of the Neceſſary Men themſelves; that nothing that was done ſhould be betrayed. And in this manner it was, that according to <hi>Junius Cordus,</hi> the Decree of the Senate againſt <hi>Maximin</hi> paſſed, to Conceal it ſo much the more from <hi>Maximin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, as there are ſome Men, who cannot keep a Secret for fear, as it were, that it ſhould burſt them, and who bluſh that what they know ſhould not be diſcovered by themſelves, and imagining that they ſhall be Men of no Conſequence, unleſs they make it appear that they are intruſted with great Matters. <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> notwithſtanding this Secrecy, ſoon came to the knowledge of what had paſſed, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52508:275"/> had a Copy of this very Decree ſent him, which was never known to be done before. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he writ a Letter to <hi>Sabinus</hi> the Governour of the City, offended at his abſence from the Senate at the time when that Decree was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; becauſe as he was a Friend of his, he ought to have been there, to have oppoſed it.

                     <p>The Emotion which <hi>Maximin</hi> was in when he received the News of the Revolt of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the Concurrence of the Senate to it, was ſuch as cannot be expreſſed. He threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<note place="margin">

His Statues and Images in the mean time, as he was a declared Enemy, were thrown down; and the Senate made all the uſe imaginable of the Power which they had taken into their hands. The Informers, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators, Receivers, and all thoſe Firebrands of the Party of <hi>Maximin</hi> they condemned to death. But this did not ſatisfie the People; who dragged them alſo through the Streets, and threw them into the Kennel. <hi>Sabinus</hi>

                     <p>When <hi>Maximin</hi> had heard of theſe things, he came preſently to his Army, and harangu'd them to this purpoſe.</p>

He ſent his Son to fight <hi>Capelianus,</hi> and the Party of the <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> that was with him.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52508:277"/> and the skilfuller Soldier won the day, and <hi>Gordianus</hi> was killed upon the place.</p>

                     </head>
                     <byline>BY JULIUS CAPITOLINUS.</byline>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GORDIANUS</hi> the Second was the Son of the precedent <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Proconſul of <hi>Africa,</hi> and was ſet up Emperor by the <hi>Africans,</hi> and by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Rome</hi> at the ſame time, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his Father. He was one, whoſe Ingenuity and Carriage of himſelf, gave him as great a Reputation, as did the Honour of his Birth; by which he was related to the ſeveral Noble Families of the <hi>Scipio's,</hi> that of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, the <hi>Antoninuſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Antonies.</hi>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52508:278"/> His Mother was <hi>Fabia Oreſtilla,</hi> a Great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter of the Emperor <hi>M. Aurelius Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> which was the reaſon that he was Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in his Infancy by the Name of <hi>Antoninus Gordianus.</hi> But yet <hi>Gordianus</hi> was the Name which adhered to him, and which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by. He was his Father's firſt Child.</p>
                     <p>In his Studies he always followed the beſt and graveſt Opinions. He was very Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, when young.</note> of an extraordinary Memory, and a kind and ſweet Diſpoſition; inſomuch, that at School, when a Child, if he ſaw ſome of the Boys beaten, he could not forbear to cry for them. His Maſter was <hi>Serenus Sammonicus,</hi> who extreamly loved him, and bequeathed to him at his death a Library which conſiſted of Sixty two Thouſand Books; being the whole Library of another <hi>Serenus Sammonicus</hi> the Father, who was put to death under the Emperor <hi>Caracalla:</hi> The ſame of which Treaſure of Learning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled <hi>Gordianus</hi> to the Heavens, and gave him a great Name amongſt the Ingenious. The Emperor <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> made him a Quaeſtor; to whom he was known, by being a young Man that loved Pleaſure; but yet without Scandal, and without ever bearing part in the infamous Luxury of that Prince. <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> made him a Praetor, for the Affairs of the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> He diſcharged himſelf ſo well, and gained ſo great an Eſteem, that he preſently after was made a Conſul, though his Father had come late to that Honour: After which, either in the time of the ſame <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52508:278"/> Severus,</hi> or in that of <hi>Maximin,</hi> he was ſent into <hi>Africa,</hi> as Lieutenant to his Father, the then Proconſul there; where what Fortune befel him, we have already recounted under the Life of his Father.</p>
                     <p>He loved Wine; but he always had it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,<note place="margin">And in his advanc'd Age.</note> either with Roſes, or Maſtick, or Wormwood, or other things, that pleaſed his Palate. He eat very little. He had dined and ſupped, as it were in a moment. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he paſſionately loved. It is ſaid, he kept two and twenty Concubines; by all which, he had three or four Children a-piece. He was called the <hi>Priamus</hi> of his Age, for the multitude of his Iſſue. In Drollery, inſtead of <hi>Priamus,</hi> they many times called him a <hi>Priapus.</hi> He ſpent his time betwixt the Gardens, the Baths, and the delightful Groves. Nor did his Father Correct him; but often ſaid, That he would one day die a Great Man. For as freely as he lived, he did not depart from that Vigor, which was natural to him; nor from the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Perſons of Honour. He was always amongſt the moſt Illuſtrious Company, and ready with the beſt of his Judgment to ſerve either the Publick, or his Friend. Therefore the Senate were very glad to Proclaim him Emperor together with his Father, and placed the Publick Hopes in him. He was juſt in his Dreſs, beloved by his Domeſticks and all that belong'd to him. <hi>Aelius Cordus</hi> ſays, that he never would conſent to Marry. But on the contrary we are told by <hi>Dexippus,</hi> that <hi>Gordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> the Third was his Son, who afterwards,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52508:279"/> whilſt he was a Youth, was advanced to the Empire, in conjunction with <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When his Father ſome time conſulted an Aſtrologer about the Nativity of him, it was anſwer'd, they ſay, That he would be both the Son and the Father of an Emperor, and an Emperor himſelf. <hi>Gordianus</hi> laughing at it as a Jeſt, the Aſtrologer ſhew'd him his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope, and undertook to prove out of the Books of the Antient Maſters of the Art of Aſtrology, that what he ſaid was true. He told him the Day, the Manner, the Place of the Death of both the Firſt and Second <hi>Gordianus;</hi> and juſtified himſelf with the greateſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy: All which <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Elder reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, when he ſaw himſelf an Emperor, he even when there was no reaſon, for him to be afraid of any thing, ſpoke very often both of his own and his Son's Death, and applied to his Son thoſe Verſes of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                        <q>Oſtendent terris hunc tantum, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <q>This Man will only to the World be ſhown,</q> lamenting his Condition, that he was not long to live.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeveral Diſcourſes and alſo Verſes of <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Second, extant, which at this day are often remembred amongſt his Friends. They are not Great, nor yet Mean; but of a middle Character, and ſuch as beſpeak him to have been an Ingenious Man, of a Luxuriant Wit, and negligent of the Parts that Nature gave him.</p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:52508:279"/>
                     <p>He was a great lover of Fruit and Herbs: In his other Diet he was very ſparing: but he was always eating ſome New Fruit or other: A great lover of all Cold things: in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he eat little elſe. He was Groſs, and much inclined to be Fat, and therefore he the rather choſe this Diet, to keep himſelf down.</p>
                     <p>This is what I have judged worthy to be remarked, concerning the Second <hi>Gordianus.</hi> For as for his domeſtick Pleaſures, and other petty things of no Obſervation, which are with ſo little judgment recollected by <hi>Junius Cordus,</hi> let any Perſon who is deſirous to know them, read him; who tells you, how many Coats and Cloaks every Prince had, what Courtiers, how many Servants; the knowledge whereof ſignifies nothing. Nor do I think, that it is the part of an Hiſtorian to trouble himſelf, but about things which it is either good to follow, or good to avoid.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only add a Paſſage, which I find in <hi>Vulcatius Terentianus,</hi> who hath writ a Hiſtory of his Time. He ſays, that <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Firſt was the Reverſe of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar;</hi> he ſpoke ſo like him, and he reſembled him ſo much in his Face and Stature. That the Second <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus</hi> was very like <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great. But as to this, I know not what to ſay: Becauſe it is denied, that <hi>Pompey</hi> was Fat or Groſs: And he further ſays, That <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Third, whoſe Statues we have now extant, reſembled the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiatick Scipio.</hi> This I thought was Remarkable and more for their Honour, than to be wholly paſs'd in ſilence.</p>

He was the Grandſon of the Emperor <hi>Gordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> the Firſt; but whether by a Daughter, as many ſay, or by his Son <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Second, who died with him in <hi>Africa,</hi> as <hi>Dexippus</hi> thinks, I cannot determine. His Mother Educated him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus</hi> Reigned two Years, and then were kill'd in a Mutiny of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. The two <hi>Maximins</hi> were extinct before. So there remaining, without any Competitor, <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Third, who had for the two years laſt paſt, been honoured with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Soldiers, the People, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and all the Country, with great Joy and Alacrity, and with extraordinary demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Affection, agreed to proclaim him Emperor: Loving him in Memory, and for the Merits of his Grandfather <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Firſt, and of his Father, or otherwiſe his Uncle <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Second, who both of them took up Arms for the Senate and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Maximin,</hi> and loſt their lives in their ſervice by the Fortune of that War.</p>
                     <p>It was look'd upon as a Sign, That <hi>Gordia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Third would not be a Prince of a long Reign; that ſuch a great Eclipſe of the Sun happen'd about that time; that the Day was turn'd into Night, and you could ſee to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without Candles. He entertained the City

Then an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection commenc'd in <hi>Africa,</hi> headed by <hi>Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus,</hi> in the Year when <hi>Venuſtus</hi> and <hi>Sabinus</hi> were the Conſuls. <hi>Gordianus</hi> Armed the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of <hi>Mauritania</hi> againſt that Revolter: who beſieged and reduced him to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that all his Party left him, and came and acknowledged their fault. After this, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a War with <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which was his ſecond Conſulſhip, and <hi>Pompeianus</hi> being then Conſuls. The young Emperor, before he went to that War, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried<note place="margin">His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law.</note> the Daughter of <hi>Myſitheus;</hi> who as he was a Perſon of great Erudition and rare Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>Gordianus</hi> thought him not unworthy to be admitted into his Alliance; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he made him his Captain of the Guards. This ſtrengthen'd his Reign. Himſelf was for his Age very Sage and very Adviſed: but being alſo aſſiſted with the Counſels of ſo excellent a Father-in-Law, nothing was acted by him that was puerile or deſpiſable; nor was he made a Property of by the Eunuchs and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Court, which he was but too much ſubject to be before this Match, whilſt he continued under the Regency of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>We have a Letter of his Father-in-Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to him, and another from him written to his Father-in-Law, in which are contained

                              <hi>IT is a Pleaſure to me to obſerve the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Times, ſince every thing was bought and ſold by the Eunuchs, and ſuch as pretended themſelves to be Friends, but were really the greateſt Enemies to your Majeſty. I am glad, that that Blot is removed from your Reign; Your Majeſty is your ſelf alſo very glad of it; which I am the more pleaſed to ſee, becauſe it ſhews, that howſoever badly Affairs have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore managed, the fault was not in you, my Son. Nor was it to your mind, that the Commands in the Army were diſpoſed of through the favour of the Eunuchs; or that Perſons were denied the Rewards due to their Services; or that they were either ſaved for Money and Affection, when they deſerved to die, or put to death, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to live. It was not by your fault that the Treaſury was exhauſted; but all theſe things lie at the door of thoſe who were continually Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and entring into Cabals to deceive you; whereby they prevented the Acceſs of Men of Virtue and Honeſty to your Perſon, prepoſſeſſing you againſt ſuch, and on the contrary, inſinuating others into your favour, as vitious as themſelves,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52508:282"/> through whoſe and their own Methods together, they made a Prey of you. The Gods be thanked that your Majeſty is ſenſible of all this, and that you have taken it into your Conſideration to Reform the State. I am happy in being the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law of ſo good a Prince: A Prince who examines into, and who will know all things, and who hath baniſhed from him thoſe, by whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was made an Auction of, and ſold to whoſoever offered moſt.</hi>

                     <p>By theſe two Letters it is eaſie to ſee, that this young Prince was much amended and rectified in his Conduct, by the Advices of <hi>Myſitheus.</hi> The Gravity and the Uprightneſs of that Man had ſuch an influence upon him, that he made <hi>Gordianus</hi> Famous, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might have paſs'd his time in great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, without any thing but his Quality to recommend him to Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>An Earthquake happened in the Reign of this Emperor, ſo terrible, that whole Cities with their People were ſwallowed up in it. On which occaſion a great many Sacrifices were celebrated in all Parts of <hi>Rome,</hi> and generally all over the World. The Books, ſays <hi>Aelius Cordus,</hi> of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> were conſulted, and all the Ceremonies being performed that ſeemed to be preſcribed therein, then this univerſal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity ceaſed.</p>

He arrived in <hi>Syria</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which was then in the hands of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Here he engaged the Enemy in ſeveral Battels, in which he had ſo much the better, that <hi>Sapores</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> was obliged to retire and leave him to poſſeſs himſelf of the Cities of <hi>Antioch, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> and <hi>Niſibin,</hi> that had all been reduced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the Empire of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Arabian</hi> born, was made the Captain of the Guards. A Man of mean Parentage, Proud, and not able to contain himſelf in ſo high and new a Fortune. He ſoon began to form
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52508:284"/> deſigns to prejudge the Army againſt the Emperor <hi>Gordianus.</hi> He brought them one time into places where there were no Proviſions in the Granaries: Another time, the Veſſels, which came charged with Corn for them by Water, were through his means diverted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. This he did maliciouſly to diſguſt them againſt <hi>Gordianus:</hi> becauſe there had been ſuch vaſt Stores laid up by <hi>Myſitheus</hi> for the uſe of the Army, that with good Conduct they knew they could not fail to be ſupplied; at the ſame time they did not ſuſpect that <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus</hi> was ſo impoſed upon by <hi>Philip:</hi> who to add yet to their Reſentments, and to blow up the Fire, cauſed a Rumour to be ſpread, that <hi>Gordianus,</hi> being ſo very young, was not a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Ability ſufficient to govern the Empire; and that it was much better that <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould be in his place, who underſtood it, and how to Command an Army. He corrupted the <hi>Principes,</hi> who are a Body of the ſtrongeſt and the ſtouteſt Men amongſt them, to his ſide; till at length, by his management he brought it about, that <hi>Philip</hi> was openly demanded to be made Emperor; which the Friends of <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus</hi> immediately oppoſed to the utmoſt: but when the Army was in a condition of ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for want of Proviſions, the Empire was devolved upon <hi>Philip;</hi> and it was agreed, that<note place="margin">He is made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</note> he ſhould Reign in conjunction with <hi>Gordianus,</hi> and ſhould be as it were the Guardian of the young Prince.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52508:285"/> in all things towards <hi>Gordianus,</hi> that as <hi>Gordianus</hi> was a Prince who had come to the Throne with Honour, of a Noble Family, and of a Race of Princes, his Father and his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father being both Emperors before him, ſo that he could not endure the intruſion of a Perſon of ſo ignoble an Original as <hi>Philip,</hi> he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in the preſence of <hi>Maecius Gordianus</hi> his Kinſman, who was the Captain of the Guards, the Officers and Soldiers of the Army together, and complained to them; how ungrateful <hi>Philip</hi> was for the Kindneſſes he had done him, and he hoped that it would be thought fit, to depoſe him from the Empire again. He ſpoke as much as he could, to that purpoſe; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, the Faction of <hi>Philip</hi> prevailed and carried it ſo againſt him, that they turned the Tables upon him, and depoſed <hi>Gordianus</hi> from the Empire. He ſeeing that his Credit was not ſo great as <hi>Philip</hi>'s, demanded that at leaſt the Power ſhould be equal betwixt them. This was denied. Then he offered to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with retaining the Quality of the <hi>Caeſar.</hi> This was alſo denied. Then he deſired, that they would not refuſe him the Office of the Captain of the Guards. But this was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. His laſt Prayer was his Life, and to ſerve <hi>Philip</hi> as a Commander in the Army. <hi>Philip</hi> had almoſt conſented to this; who ſaid nothing himſelf, but directed his Party in all things by Nods and private Signs. But when he conſidered with himſelf the Affection which the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> together with all <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and indeed all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52508:285"/> had for <hi>Gordianus,</hi> as being of a Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and both the Son and Grandſon of an Emperor, and one that had done great Services to the Empire in the Wars, he thought that it might one day happen, that the Army by ſome unforeſeen Accident, might take a fancy to re-inthrone him again, becauſe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Animoſity, which was upon the occaſion of their want of Proviſions, was but a Paſſion that might not laſt always; and therefore he ordered him to be carried out of ſight (<hi>Gordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> crying as he went) and to be diſrobed of the Purple and killed; which after a little he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation was done accordingly, after he had reigned ſix Years.</p>
                     <p>Thus by Blood, and not by Right, did the Emperor <hi>Philip</hi> raiſe himſelf. In the mean time <hi>Argunthis,</hi> King of <hi>Scythia,</hi> ravaged the Kingdoms adjoyning to him, unto which he was encouraged, eſpecially by the death of <hi>Myſitheus,</hi> by whoſe Counſels the Empire had been ſo well governed before under <hi>Gordianus.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Philip,</hi> willing to conceal his acceſſion to the Empire by Blood, ſent Letters to <hi>Rome</hi> with a quite different Account; in which he ſaid, that <hi>Gordianus</hi> was dead of a Sickneſs, and that as for himſelf, all the Army had elected him Emperor. The Senate was eaſily to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Truth of things at that diſtance. They accepted and proclaim'd <hi>Philip</hi> Emperor, and repoſed the deceaſed <hi>Gordianus</hi> in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gods. He was a handſome, gay,<note place="margin">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52508:286"/> nothing but Age for the Throne. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Senate loved him, and ſo alſo did the Army, before the Faction of <hi>Philip,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any Prince that they had ever had yet. All the Soldiers and the Senate, ſays <hi>Cordus,</hi> called him their Son, and all the People called him their Darling. Nor did <hi>Philip</hi> after he had killed him, take away his Images, or throw down his Statues, or raze out his Name: He always gave him the Title of a God, amongſt the very Party with whom he had confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt him: He ſeriouſly honoured him; but not without mixing with his Worſhip, a great deal of foreign Craft and Diſſimulation.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe of the <hi>Gordiani</hi> is ſtanding at<note place="margin">His Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> this day. It was very finely beautified by this laſt Prince. Their <hi>Villa</hi> or Country-Seat, is upon the Way that leads to <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> conſiſting of two hundred Pillars of four ſeveral Orders; fifty of the Marble of <hi>Caryſto</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Negrepont,</hi> fifty of the <hi>Claudian</hi> Marble, fifty of that of the City <hi>Synnada</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and fifty of that of <hi>Numidia,</hi> all of the ſame meaſure: There are three Galleries three hundred foot long: The reſt is ſuitable to the Work, and the Baths ſuch, as no part of the World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Rome,</hi> can parallel. The Senate decreed this extraordinary privilege to the Family of the <hi>Gordiani,</hi> that their Poſterity, if they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, might for ever be exempted from Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, Embaſſies, and all other publick Duties. There are no Publick Buildings by this laſt Prince extant at <hi>Rome,</hi> beſides ſome Fountains and Baths: The Baths he built not neither
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52508:286"/> for publick, but only private uſe. He had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to build a Royal Structure in the <hi>Field of Mars,</hi> at the foot of the Mount, conſiſting of two Galleries of a thouſand foot length each, and the diſtance of five hundred foot from one another; the Interſpace on either ſide to be adorned with Greens, compoſed of Laurel, Myrtle, and Box; and in the middle a Terraſs of the length of the Galleries, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained with rows of ſmall Pillars, and having over head another ſtately Gallery of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot. Beſides this, he, with the direction of <hi>Myſitheus,</hi> had deſigned to build a Summer Bath, which ſhould bear his own Name; and alſo other Baths for the Winter, for the uſe of this Place, to render both the Greens, the Galleries, and the whole Work the more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But all theſe things have ſince been in the occupation of private Perſons, and are now taken up in their Houſes, Gardens, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements.</p>
                     <p>There was at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, two and thirty Elephants, whereof two and twenty were of his own ſending thither; the other ten were brought by the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus.</hi> Beſides theſe, there were ten Elks, ten Tygres, ſixty tame Lions, thirty tame Leopards, ten Hyaena's, a thouſand couple of Gladiators, who were maintained at the Charge of the Exchequer: One Sea-Horſe, one Rhinoceros, ten White and Wild Lions, ten Camel-Panthers, twenty Wild Aſſes, forty Wild Horſes, and an innumerable company of other Beaſts of divers kinds; all which <hi>Gordianus</hi> had
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52508:287"/> prepared to adorn his <hi>Perſian</hi> Triumph. But in this the Publick Wiſh had not its effect.

                     <p>AFter the Death of <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Firſt, and his Son <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Second in <hi>Africa,</hi> which happened in the time that <hi>Maximin</hi> was marching againſt <hi>Italy,</hi> in a great rage to revenge his own depoſition from the Empire, and their elevation to it in his Place: the Senate full of fears of the Attempts and Fury of ſo Cruel an Enemy, aſſembled
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52508:288"/> themſelves in the Temple of <hi>Concord,</hi> upon the Seventh of the Calends of <hi>July,</hi> being the Anniverſary of the Games in Honour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> to conſider what courſe to take in order to their ſecurity againſt him. <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus</hi> were then two Perſons of the firſt Note in the Senate, who had been Conſuls; whereof the one, that is, <hi>Maximus,</hi> excelled in Valour and in ſtrictneſs of Diſcipline; and the other, <hi>Balbinus,</hi> excelled as much in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Theſe two coming into the Senate, and expreſſing in their very entrance their concern for the News of the Deſign of <hi>Maximin,</hi> the Conſul, who was making a Report to the Senate of ſome things of another Nature, was Anſwer'd by the Senator of the Firſt Voice thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We trouble our ſelves here about Matters of ſmall Moment, and little better in compariſon than Old Wives Stories, at a time that really challenges the higheſt Conſideration of the Senate. For what have we to do to Treat now upon the Repairing of Temples, and the Adorning a Baſilica, of the Baths of</hi> Titus, <hi>and the Rebuilding the Amphitheatre, when</hi> Maximin <hi>is at our Heels, whom you with me have declared an Enemy. The two</hi> Gordiani, <hi>in whom our Security was, are dead; nor is there at this preſent any Remedy for us whereunto to recur. Come, Gentlemen, appoint who ſhall be our Emperors. What do you loſe Time for? Leſt whilſt you perplex your ſelves every one with your Fears, your rather periſh in thoſe Fears, than by Valour and Bravery ſeek to effect our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi>

                     <p>The Senate was in a profound ſilence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, when <hi>Maximus,</hi> whoſe Age as well as his Merits, and his Valour and Severity of Diſcipline rendred him moſt Illuſtrious, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak his Opinion the next; which was, that it was neceſſary, that there ſhould be two Emperors appointed, who ſhould Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in conjunction with one another: <hi>Vectius Sabinus</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Ulpii,</hi> deſired the leave of the Conſul to be heard, which was granted, and he ſpoke thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is certain, Gentlemen, that in Changes that are ſo ſudden as this, there is nothing like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving; and the Counſels, which offer themſelves to our Thoughts, are rather to be immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, than diſputed. To what purpoſe are many Words, and fine Speeches, where Affairs are ſo urgent? Let every one have a care of his own Neck; and think upon his Wife and Children, and the Eſtate which he inherits from Anceſtors. All which are under imminent danger from</hi> Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; <hi>whoſe Nature it is to be Furious, Truculent, Barbarous; but yet his Cauſe, which as he thinks, is ſo Juſt, will make him ſtill much worſe.

You have my Opinion, Gentlemen, which is perhaps more dangerous to my ſelf, than to you: But yet neither is it very ſafe to you, unleſs you make either ſome other, or theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, our Emperors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole Houſe unanimouſly anſwer'd, <hi>It is Juſt: It is Juſt: We all agree to the Opinion of</hi> Sabinus: Maximus <hi>and</hi> Balbinus, <hi>the Gods ſave your Majeſties: The Gods have made you our Emperors: The Gods preſerve you. Do you defend the Senate againſt the Robbers of the Party of</hi> Maximin. <hi>We commit the War againſt the Robbers to you. Let</hi> Maximin, <hi>the Publick Enemy, with his Son periſh. Purſue the Publick Enemy. You are happy in the Judgment of the Senate: The State is happy in you to ſit upon the Throne. What the Senate hath deferred to you, undertake with Courage: What the Senaete hath given you, accept it freely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So with theſe, and ſuch other Acclamations,<note place="margin">Maximus <hi>and</hi> Balbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</hi>

                        <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus</hi> were conſtituted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</p>
                     <p>From the Senate they went firſt to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol, and aſſiſted at the Sacrifices there. Whilſt they were at the Capitol, the Populace contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the Election of <hi>Maximus,</hi> becauſe they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52508:290"/> fear'd his Severity; and they deſired, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Gordianus,</hi> Grandſon of the Emperor <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus</hi> the Firſt, of about thirteen Years of Age, ſhould be made the <hi>Caeſar.</hi> From the Capitol, <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus</hi> went to the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> which is the Place to Harangue the People in upon the ſubject of their Election. As they had done this, the People there, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome Soldiers who joined them, cried, <hi>We all deſire to have</hi> Gordianus Caeſur. Nor would they permit the Emperors, who were attended with their Guards, to depart from thence, to go to the Palace, till this was granted: ſo that <hi>Gordianus</hi> was preſently taken and carried into the Senate, and the Senate the ſame day, which was a new thing, that they had paſſed the Act in the favour of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus</hi> to be Emperors, Aſſembled a ſecond time, and paſſed another Act in the<note place="margin">Gordiaus <hi>declar'd.

                        </note> favour of <hi>Gordianus</hi> to be the <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Motion, which the two Emperors after their Elevation made to the Senate, was, That the two <hi>Gordiani,</hi> who were dead in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> ſhould be Deified. Some ſay, this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made only for the Father, who had ſtrangled himſelf. But as the Son died the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourabler death, by being killed in the Field, I chooſe rather to believe the Report of <hi>Junius Cordus,</hi> in whom I remember that I have read, that they were both Deified. After this, they conferred the Office of Governour of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> upon <hi>Vectius Sabinus:</hi> who was a Grave Perſon, ſuitable to the Temper of <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus;</hi> and they made <hi>Pinarius Valens</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guards.</p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52508:290"/>
                     <p>Before I ſpeak more of their other Actions, I will give you ſome Account of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Families: which is done before me indeed by <hi>Junius Cordus,</hi> and by <hi>Curius Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natianus.</hi> The firſt ſuffers nothing to eſcape him: ſo that many times he takes in things that are Vile, and not Handſome. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath gone through all this Hiſtory; and hath amaſſed together ſeveral things which are not to be found elſewhere. But he is ſo ſhort, that he only touches upon them. I ſhall not follow the Method of the one or the other; but rather that of the Hiſtories of <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> and <hi>Valerius Marcellinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximus</hi>'s Father was one out of the loweſt<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus.</note> Rank of the People; a Coach-maker, or as ſome ſay, a Blackſmith; whoſe Wife's Name was <hi>Prima,</hi> by whom he had four other Boys, and four Girls, that all of them died young. When <hi>Maximus</hi> was born, an Eagle, they ſay, dropt into the Chamber where he was, through ſome Paſſage, ſeveral pieces of raw Fleſh: which no body daring to meddle with, or touch, out of a ſcruple of Religion, the Eagle came and took it away again, and carried it into the next Chappel, which was dedicated to <hi>Jupiter Praeſtes.</hi> This at that time ſeemed to be a thing of no conſequence; but his coming afterwards to the Empire ſhew'd, that it was not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe, and that it was an Omen of his Reign. He paſſed all his Infancy in the Houſe of his Uncle <hi>Pinarius,</hi> his Father's Brother; whom he raiſed to the Dignity of the Captain of the Guards, as ſoon as he was made Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52508:291"/> He employed his time to the ſtudy of Grammar, but not much to Rhetorick; for his inclination was always to Arms and the ſevere diſcipline of War. At length he came to be a Tribune in the Army, and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeveral Legions, and after that was made a Praetor. His Charges at his entrance into his Praetorſhip, were born by <hi>Peſcennia Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> who had adopted him, and maintain'd him as her own Son. Next, he was made the Proconſul of <hi>Bithynia;</hi> from <hi>Bithynia</hi> he was removed to <hi>Greece;</hi> and from thence, in the third place, to be the Proconſul of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis.</hi> He was ſent, in the Quality of Lieutenant-General, into <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum,</hi> where he beat the <hi>Sarmatae:</hi> From thence he was commanded to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where he managed things very happily againſt the <hi>Germans.</hi> Then he was made the Governour of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which place he acquitted himſelf with a great deal of Prudence, Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and Exactneſs. Therefore the Senate, though he was one of a Novel Family, which without extraordinary Merits muſt have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their Favour, did not forbear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Empire upon him; confeſſing, as did all the World, that at time there was no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Senate more fit to ſuſtain the Name and Dignity of a Prince, than he.</p>
                     <p>As to his Perſon and his Manners, which<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Perſon and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of</hi> Maximus.</note> are Circumſtances, tho' of the leſſer moment, into which People generally delight to enquire, he was one that Eat much, but Drank very little; and Venery he extraordinary rarely uſed.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52508:291"/> Always of a ſevere Carriage at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; a very grave Look, and a hard Face; ſo that they epitheted him <hi>Maximus</hi> the Triſt. He was Tall, Strong, and Healthy in Body: one of no great Complaiſance, but Juſt, and never guilty to the laſt of Inhumanity or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs towards any. He always forgave, when he was asked; nor was he ever Angry, but where it became him ſo to be. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himſelf to no Parties: he was ſtedfaſt in his own Judgment, and would never ſo much truſt to the Sentiments of others, as to his own. The Senate loved him the better for all this, and the People feared him. Thoſe latter knew the weight of his Cenſure, being a Subject; and they thought, that the ſame rigour would but increaſe upon him being a Prince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Balbinus</hi> was a Man of a very Noble Race;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Character of</hi> Balbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> had been twice Conſul, and the Governour of a multitude of Provinces. He had been the Governour of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Gallia,</hi> and had headed ſometimes Armies. But to ſay the truth, his Excellency lay not ſo much in the Military, as in the Civil Affairs. His Goodneſs, his Integrity, and his Modeſty, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a great deal of love. His Family was very Antient; and as he ſaid, derived from <hi>Balbus Cornelius Theophanes;</hi> who was made Free of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, and who was a Man of the firſt Note in his own Country, and alſo a writer of Hiſtory. <hi>Balbinus</hi> was as Tall as <hi>Maximus,</hi> and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52508:292"/> he loved his Pleaſures extremely, in which he had a great Eſtate to aſſiſt him: for he was left Rich by his Anceſtors; and he had added to that Stock much, by being made the Heir to ſeveral of his Friends. He was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for his Eloquence; a very good Poet at a ſudden and an <hi>extempore</hi> Verſe. He loved Wine, Women, and good Eating; was proper in his Dreſs, and in fine, wanted nothing to render him commendable to the People. The Senate no leſs loved him. This as to the general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus:</hi> whom ſome, as <hi>Saluſt</hi> compares <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſo ſome think, ought to be compared in this manner. That as <hi>Maximus</hi> was ſevere, <hi>Balbinus</hi> was ſweet: As the one was Firm and Conſtant, the other was Good. The one gave away no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the other abounded in all things, and was as generous to all the World with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus,</hi> being poſſeſſed with all the other Royal Honours and Enſigns of the Empire; that is, having received the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunitian Power, the Proconſular Power and the Soveraign Pontificate upon them; the Title of <hi>Fathers of the Country,</hi> was likewiſe added to them. They entertain'd the People with the diverſions of the Stage, the Games of the Cirque, and the Combats of the Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and then <hi>Maximus,</hi> after the diſpatching his Vows in the Capitol, was ſent to the War againſt <hi>Maximin</hi> with a great Army; the Guards continuing with <hi>Balbinus</hi> ſtill at <hi>Rome.</hi> I may here take an occaſion to ſay, in a word, from whence the Cuſtom comes, That when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52508:292"/> the Emperors are going to a War, they firſt entertain the People with the Combats of Gladiators, and the Chaſe of Beaſts. Some will have it, That it is an antient ſort of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> the Goddeſs of Fortune; to ſatiate her with <hi>Roman</hi> Blood in the beginning; that ſhe may have the leſs thereof to require in the Engagements with the Enemy. But that which I take to be the trueſt, and the moſt probable Account of it, is; That the ſight of Fights, Blood, Arms, and naked Men engaging each other, ſhould harden them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt they met the Enemy, and accuſtom them not to be afraid, nor to ſhrink at all at Death and Wounds.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Guards</hi> tarrying, as I ſaid, at <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt <hi>Maximus</hi> went to the War againſt <hi>Maximin,</hi> there happened ſuch a violent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition betwixt the People and them, that it<note place="margin">

The greateſt part whereof was ſet on fire, the Temples prophaned, the Streets all of them polluted with Blood, and <hi>Balbinus</hi> with his utmoſt Lenity was not able to pacifie them: to do which he appeared in publick in Perſon. But he was in danger to be knock'd down with a Stone: ſome ſay, that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a blow with a Club; and he could never have quieted them, if he had not thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on producing the young Caeſar <hi>Gordianus,</hi> whom he took, dreſs'd in his Purple, and ſet him upon the Shoulders of one that was very tall, and expoſed him to them: who ſeeing him, both the People and the Soldiers were
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52508:293"/> ſo appeaſed, that for his ſake they all retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again to their former Amity: For never was one of his Years, ſo much beloved as he; in Memory particularly of his Father, and his Grandfather, who had laid down their Lives in the defence of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt <hi>Maximin</hi> in <hi>Africk.</hi> A great Inſtance of the Gratitude of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <hi>Maximus</hi> ſet forwards for the War, the Senate diſpatched into all parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Italy</hi> Conſuls, Praetors, Quaeſtors, Aediles and Tribunes, to ſee, that every City was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Corn, Arms, Walls, and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to give <hi>Maximin</hi> at every turn a Check, and to fatigue him with Sieges one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They ordered all the Proviſions to be reaped, and to be brought out of the Fields into the fortified Towns, that the Publick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſhould find nothing whereupon to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. They ſent Orders into all the Provinces, to forbid all Perſons to Aſſiſt him, under the penalty of being treated as Enemies. In the mean time another Mutiny happened at <hi>Rome</hi> betwixt the City and Guards. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Balbinus</hi> publiſhed his Edicts to ſuppreſs them, but without effect. The Guards betook themſelves to their Camp. The People began to beſiege them there. Nor was this Mutiny, in which Thieves and Robbers mixed with the reſt, to ſteal and plunder what they could, to the ruin of the City, and the loſs of a great deal of Riches, quieted, till the People had gone ſo far as to cut <hi>Aquaeducts</hi> that carried the Water to the Camp.</p>

                     <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Maximus</hi> was at the City of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> making great preparations for the War againſt <hi>Maximin;</hi> whom he very much apprehended, and often ſaid, that he went to fight not againſt a Man, but againſt a <hi>Cyclops.</hi> But <hi>Maximin</hi> was ſo defeated of his Deſigns before the City of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> that his own Men killed him, and both the Heads of him and his Son were brought to <hi>Ravenna</hi> to <hi>Maximus,</hi> who ſent them from thence to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Zeal of the People of <hi>Aquileia</hi> for the Cauſe of the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Siege was remarkable. They ſhaved off the Womens Hair in their neceſſity, to make Strings with it for their Bows. The Emperor <hi>Balbinus</hi> was ſo overjoy'd at the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, who had dreaded the very thoughts of <hi>Maximin</hi> before, that as ſoon as his Head was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> he offered a Hecatomb to the Gods; which is a Sacrifice in this manner: A hundred Altars made of Turf, are ſet up<note place="margin">Offering of a Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomb.</note> all in a place. Upon theſe Altars are killed a hundred Swine, or a hundred Sheep. If it is an Imperial Sacrifice, the Victims are a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Lions, or a hundred Eagles, and ſuch like. A Cuſtom which many Emperors have Celebrated; and it formerly was in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> to appeaſe the Gods, in time eſpecially of a Peſtilence.</p>
                     <p>This being over, <hi>Balbinus</hi> in the next place with great joy expected the return of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Emperor from <hi>Ravenna,</hi> with his Army and Forces entire, which had had no occaſion to ſtrike a blow. For the People of <hi>Aquileia,</hi>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:52508:294"/> and only a few Soldiers with them under the Command of <hi>Criſpinus</hi> and <hi>Menophilus,</hi> who had been ſent thither from the Senate, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their Work, and defeated the Enemy without them. <hi>Maximus</hi> took his way from <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi> firſt to <hi>Aquileia,</hi> to ſee that he left all the Country ſafe, as far as to the <hi>Alps;</hi> and if there were any Reliques of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> remaining who had favoured <hi>Maximin,</hi> to reduce them. In the mean time the Senate deputed twenty of their Body (to wit, four of the Order of the Conſuls, eight Praetors and eight Quaeſtors) whoſe Names are ſet down by <hi>Cordus,</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement <hi>Maximus,</hi> and to preſent him with the Crowns, as alſo an Act, in which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to ſet up his Statues on Horſeback in Gold. The Emperor <hi>Balbinus</hi> was diſguſted at this, and ſaid, that <hi>Maximus</hi> had been put to leſs trouble than he, who had extinguiſh'd the fire of a great inteſtine War at home, whilſt <hi>Maximus</hi> enjoy'd himſelf in quiet at <hi>Ravenna.</hi> But tho' this was true, the readineſs of <hi>Maximus</hi> to ſerve the State in Perſon in this War, was ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that the Victory received was totally imputed to him; and yet it was got, before he ſo much as knew any thing of it. The Army of <hi>Maximin,</hi> after his death, ſurrendring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Maximus,</hi> he received them, and marched with great Pomp and a numerous Retinue to <hi>Rome.</hi> He often ſaid to that Army, that as for what was paſt, it ought to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; and he preſented them a great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native; and ſent their Auxiliaries every one home. But as when Soldiers have once their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52508:294"/> minds poſſeſſed with a hatred, it is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to govern them. Theſe Men repented that they had loſt an Emperor, who was of their own Election, now to be reduced under the Command of thoſe, who were of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Senate. They diſcover'd as much in their very Looks, and ſometimes in Words. But when they alſo heard the reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Acclamations of the Senate upon them, for having adhered ſo to <hi>Maximin,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the bitterer againſt <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and every day bethought themſelves of ſetting up ſome other Perſons for the Empire, if occaſion ſerved.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Maximus</hi> entred into the City of <hi>Rome,</hi>

                        <hi>Balbinus,</hi> the Senate, and the People came out to meet him, reflecting upon the Soldiers of the Party of <hi>Maximin,</hi> in their Publick Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. From thence they conducted him into the Senate: where after ſome other things of courſe, it was ſaid; <hi>See the Happineſs of Princes, that are choſen by the Wiſdom of the Senate; and on the other hand, ſee the Fate of thoſe that are choſen by Fools:</hi> Now the Army were they that had firſt ſet up <hi>Maximin;</hi> as the Senate were they who had choſen <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus.</hi> The Soldiers could not hear this without being more incenſed againſt the Senate; eſpecially becauſe the Senate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as it were, to have got a Triumph over them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus</hi> governed in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> with great Prudence, and to the equal ſatisfaction of the Senate and the People.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52508:295"/> They deferred very much to the Senate; made excellent and Wiſe Laws; ſat in Perſon in Judicature, and admirably ordered all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Affairs. <hi>Maximus</hi> prepared all things for a War againſt the <hi>Parthians;</hi> and <hi>Balbinus</hi> prepared himſelf for another againſt the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> deſigning to leave the young Caeſar, <hi>Gordianus,</hi> behind them at <hi>Rome.</hi> But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Soldiers in the mean time, ſought an opportunity to kill them, but had not yet found any, becauſe they were ſo well guarded with a Body of <hi>Germans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some Differences there were betwixt <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jealouſies between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</note> and <hi>Balbinus;</hi> but they were ſecret, and ſuch as were rather to be gueſſed, than ſeen <hi>Balbinus</hi> look'd upon <hi>Maximus,</hi> as an Ignoble Man, of no Birth; and <hi>Maximus</hi> ſpurned at <hi>Balbinus</hi> again, as a weak Man of no Policy. This gave an occaſion to the Soldiers, that had Wit, to underſtand, that it was eaſie to kill two ſuch Princes, as could not agree betwixt themſelves. Whilſt therefore a great many both of the Guards and the Courtiers were diverting themſelves at the Publick Games a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and the two Emperors were left alone in the Palace, with only ſome <hi>Germans</hi> near them, they Attacked them. The <hi>Germans</hi> were at a particular part of the Palace, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Balbinus.</hi> The Storm fell upon <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> who not finding any means to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without the ſuccour of the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſent to <hi>Balbinus</hi> to deſire him to ſend him a Guard. <hi>Balbinus</hi> ſuſpecting a Plot againſt himſelf, out of an ambition of <hi>Maximus</hi> to Reign <hi>Sole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:52508:295"/> delayed to ſend him any ſo long, that whilſt they ſtood in contradiction of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon that Subject, the Soldiers came upon them both, and ſtript them of their Royal Veſtments, and drew them by violence out of the Palace, and abuſed them, and cut them, and were hurrying them through the City in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Camp; when perceiving that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> advanced to relieve them, they killed<note place="margin">They are both ſlain.</note> them both and left them dead in the Streets. At the ſame time they took the young <hi>Caeſar Gordianus</hi> with them into the Camp, whither they retired, and proclaimed him Emperor, as he was the only Perſon left at preſent to be ſo, Triumphing and Inſulting over the Senate and the People. The <hi>Germans</hi> having nothing to do to Fight, after their Maſters were killed, betook themſelves to their own Quarter, which they had without the City.</p>
                     <p>Thus died thoſe two good Emperors, in a manner unworthy of their Virtues and Actions; for nothing was more Brave than <hi>Maximus,</hi> and nothing more Sweet than <hi>Balbinus.</hi> One may be certain of this, from the Nature of the thing it ſelf: For when the Election is in their own power, why ſhould they make choice of ill Princes? They were Men, that had been exerciſed before in ſeveral employments of Honour and Power. The one had been twice Conſul, the other the Governour of the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> and both were of an advanced Age when they came to the Empire, and were beloved by the Senate; and though the People at the firſt apprehended the Reign of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:52508:296"/> yet finding him more Gracious than they expected, even thoſe had begun to lay aſide their Fears, and to Love him alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus</hi> reigned one Year. <hi>Maximin</hi> and his Son reigned two, or as ſome ſay, three Years. The Houſe of <hi>Balbinus</hi> is ſtill to be ſeen at <hi>Rome,</hi> a large and ſtately Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, poſſeſſed by his Family to this day. There is a great diſagreement amongſt the Greek and Latin Hiſtorians about the Names of <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Pupienus:</hi> which are indeed but two Names for the ſame Perſon: But yet the Greek Hiſtorians, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Dexip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> whom I have followed, never uſing the Name of <hi>Pupienus,</hi> and the Latin Hiſtorians ſcarce ever uſing the Name of <hi>Maximus;</hi> but what the one ſays was done by <hi>Maximus,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaying it was done by <hi>Pupienus,</hi> and making <hi>Pupienus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus</hi> to be Emperors together inſtead of <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus.</hi> To avoid this diſtraction, we are only to confide in the Account of <hi>Curius Fortunatianus,</hi> where he tells us, that as both the Names underſtand the ſame Perſon, he was called <hi>Pupienus,</hi> as by his own Name, and <hi>Maximus,</hi> as by the Name of his Father.

                     <p>
                        <hi>VALERIAN</hi> was in the Province of <hi>Rhaetia,</hi> when the Army ſet him up to be Emperor, with the unanimous conſent and approbation of the Senate and the People. He was a Man of an Honourable Birth, the Son of <hi>Valerius;</hi> and he was one, who in his time had paſſed through all the Gradual Offices and Honours of the State, with great applauſe, which paved the Way for him to the Throne.</p>
                     <p>To let you ſee the Eſteem, which the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick<note place="margin">Reſpect of the Senate to him.</note> had of his Merits, and how well he ſtood in the opinion of the moſt Noble Senate, at the time when he was choſen to be a Cenſor, I will give you the Act of the Senate, which paſſed for his Election.</p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:52508:301"/>
                     <p>Upon the ſixth of the Kalends of <hi>November,</hi> the Year in which the two <hi>Decii</hi> were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, the Senate having received from thoſe Princes Letters, in which they left it to the Senate's Power to appoint a Perſon to the Place of a Cenſor, met for the purpoſe in the Temple of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and the Motion being made and the Queſtion put, whom they ſhould Chooſe, inſtead of waiting to be asked their Votes ſeverally according to the Cuſtom, they all cried with one Voice, in the abſence of <hi>Valerian,</hi> who was then in the Field with the Emperors:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Life of</hi> Valerian <hi>is a continued Cenſorſhip. As his Manners are Better than all the World beſides; ſo let him be the Judge of the Manners of all the World. Let him judge of the Crimes of the Senate, who hath none of his own: Let him give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon our Lives, who leads ſuch a one himſelf, as nothing can be objected to it.</hi> Valerian <hi>hath been a Cenſor from his Infancy.</hi> Valerian <hi>hath all his Life been a Cenſor. He is a Prudent, a Modeſt, a Grave Senator; a Friend to the Good, an Enemy to Rebellion, an Enemy to all Vice and Wickedneſs. We all Accept him to be our Cenſor. We will all Obſerve him. A Man of the Firſt Quality, Noble by Blood, of a Correct Life, and Singular Manners, Eminent in his Learning, and a perfect Model of Antiquity.</hi> This was often repeated, and then the Senate Adjourned.</p>
                     <p>When the Emperor <hi>Decius</hi> had received this Act, which was ſent to him from the Senate, he aſſembled all thoſe of his Court, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, he order'd <hi>Valerian</hi> to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52508:302"/> and after the Act of the Senate was read to the Company, he made the following Speech to <hi>Valerian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You are Happy</hi> Valerian, <hi>in the Judgment</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Speech of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to him.</note> 
                        <hi>which all the Senate hath of you, and in the ſhare that you bear in their Hearts and Affections. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Office of being a Cenſor to the whole</hi> Roman <hi>World, unto which they have appointed you, and which you alone deſerve to bear. By this you are made a Judge of our Manners. You will Judge, who ought to abide in the Senate: You will reduce the</hi> Equeſtrian <hi>Order unto its Antient State: You will preſcribe Bounds to the Revenues of all. You will confirm the Tribute which is raiſed upon the People. You will take an Account of all Offices in the Government. You will have the Authority of making Laws, of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Orders of the Soldiers, and of having your Eyes upon the Conduct and the Employs of Arms. You will have the Power of carrying your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my own Court, and to the Governours of the Provinces, and the moſt Eminent Commanders in my Service. Excepting only the Governour of the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>the two Conſuls for the Year, the Chief Officer of the Sacrifices, and the Mother of the Veſtal Virgins, provided that ſhe keep her ſelf Uncorrupt, there is no Body, nor no Cauſe, but will fall under your Sentence. And even thoſe who are excepted, will labour nevertheleſs to pleaſe you, and to be agreeable in your ſight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reply which <hi>Valerian</hi> made to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, was in this manner:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>May it pleaſe Your moſt Excellent Majeſty, I beſeech you, not to tie me to ſuch a neceſſity of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52508:302"/> Judging of the People, the Soldiers, the Senate, and all the World indeed, the Magiſtrates of the Provinces, the Tribunes, and the Generals. Theſe are things, for which your Majeſty poſſeſſes the Name of an Emperor; the Cenſorſhip revolves upon your ſelf; a private Man cannot perform it. I beg therefore, that I may be excuſed from this Honour: Neither my Life, nor my Aſſurance makes me ſuitable for it: The Times alſo are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, that it is the Voice of Mankind, to deſire not to ſee a Cenſorſhip of a private Perſon of this Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However <hi>Valerian</hi> acquitted himſelf in his Cenſorſhip with all Equity. I could produce ſeveral other Inſtances of the Favour, both of the Senate and the Emperors towards him, if they were not things that are already generally known. From whence, I would only obſerve, that it appears, that when <hi>Valerian</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called to the Empire, it was not done by a Tumultuary concourſe of the People, nor by a Noiſe of the Soldiers, but he was choſen juſtly for his Merits, and as it were by the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Voice of Mankind: in which, if every Perſon in particular had been to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the power of ſpeaking his Opinion, they would all have made choice of no other than <hi>Valerian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After <hi>Valerian</hi> was upon the Throne, no Man acted in the diſpoſition of Commands and Offices, better, and more juſtly than he. His Son <hi>Gallienus,</hi> the Brother to <hi>Valerian</hi> the Second, by another Venter, was at the ſame time made <hi>Caeſar,</hi> at the requeſt of the People.</p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:52508:303"/>
                     <p>In fine, the fatal Overthrow of <hi>Valerian</hi> and his Captivity that followed it, makes me almoſt aſham'd to extol him ſo highly, as he otherwiſe deſerves. For this Prince marching with a great Force againſt <hi>Perſia,</hi> and invading that Kingdom, and being through the Conduct, whether Treacherous or Unfortunate, I know not, of one of his Officers, on whom he greatly relied, brought into ſuch Circumſtances, that no Force, nor no Military Diſcipline, could ſave him, was Conquer'd, and fell a Priſoner into the hands of <hi>Sapores</hi> King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> who ſwelled with the ſucceſs of ſo glorious Victory, not only proudly detained him, contrary to the Honour of Arms, but treated him in the Language of a vile and abject Slave, and ſome ſay, condemned him to the infamous Office of making his Back a Footſtool to him to tread upon, whenever he mounted his Horſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that is, it is certain, that ſeveral of the Neighbouring Kings, who had aſſiſted on the ſide of <hi>Sapores</hi> againſt <hi>Valerian</hi> in the War, ſent Letters afterwards of kind Interceſſion to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pores</hi> on behalf of the Royal Priſoner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of two or three were as follows:</p>

                           <p>IF I could think it poſſible, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were to be totally at laſt Vanquiſhed, I ſhould Congratulate you upon the Exalted manner, in which you uſe your Victory. But as they are a

You may pleaſe to obſerve, what great Nations the <hi>Romans</hi> have, of Enemies, made their own; and Nations that have often had the advantage of beating them too. It is certain we have heard, how the <hi>Gauls</hi> beat them, and ſet fire to their great City. But yet the <hi>Gauls</hi> are now Slaves to the <hi>Romans.</hi> What! Have not the <hi>Africans</hi> Beat them? But yet the <hi>Africans</hi> now ſerve the <hi>Romans.</hi> And not to inſtance in Examples, which are of a great diſtance from us, and therefore the leſs known, <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> was once the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all <hi>Aſia.</hi> But yet <hi>Mithridates</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and <hi>Aſia</hi> is now certainly under the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>Romans.</hi> If you will be adviſed by me, embrace the Means of Peace, which you have in your hands, and reſtore <hi>Valerian</hi> to his Country again.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Macrianus</hi> was accounted one of the moſt knowing Captains of that time, and no Man fitter for the Government of Affairs than he. Withal he was very Rich, and one that could ſupply the publick Occaſions out of his private Fortunes. His Sons, <hi>Macrianus</hi> the Second and <hi>Quietus</hi> were two ſtout young Men, who loved the War, and might be of good Example to the Legions, upon all opportunities, where the matter of Arms might call them.</p>

                        </note> of <hi>Valerian, Odenatus</hi> conſidering the Remiſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Gallienus</hi> on the one hand, and the Uſurpation of <hi>Aureolus</hi> on the other, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the diſturbed Condition of the whole Empire every where, haſtned upon this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity with an Army, to ſee if he could take the other Son of <hi>Macrianus, Quietus,</hi> who had been left behind in the Eaſt. This Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was ſoon concluded by the Treachery of ſuch, as were about the Perſon of <hi>Quietus:</hi> For they, Confederating with <hi>Odenatus,</hi> and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52508:307"/> particularly <hi>Baliſta,</hi> the Captain of the Guards, killed the young Man and threw his Body over the Wall to <hi>Odenatus;</hi> to whom every one, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, immediately ſubmitting, <hi>Odenatus</hi> be came the Emperor of almoſt all the Eaſt, whilſt <hi>Aureolus</hi> reigned in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> reigned at <hi>Rome.</hi> The City of <hi>Emiſſa</hi> was nigh deſtroyed by the ſeverity of <hi>Baliſta</hi> at this time, and many of the Inhabitants killed, with the Treaſurer and ſuch others of the Party of <hi>Quietus,</hi> as had fled for ſhelter thither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Odenatus</hi> ordered an Account of every thing that had paſſed, to be faithfully ſent to the Emperor <hi>Gallienus</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> as if it was in his Cauſe, that he had done what he did. <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was pleaſed with the ſecurity, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued to him by the death of <hi>Macrianus,</hi> and his Sons: But the uſe that he made of it, was<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of</hi> Gallienus.</note> only to indulge his Luſts and Pleaſures the more, which he purſued without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Condition of his Captive Father. He gave the Publick the diverſions of the Races of the Cirque, Stage-plays, the Games of Leaping, Running and Wreſtling; a Chaſe of Wild Beaſts, and the Games of the Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; whereunto he invited the People to aſſiſt and be Merry, as upon Days of the greateſt Joy and Triumph. However, ſeveral could not but lament the Captivity of his Father: but <hi>Gallienus</hi> gloried rather in it; becauſe his Father (he ſaid) had loſt his Crown by I know not what love of Virtue, which he renounced; and ſo he ſolaced himſelf above meaſure. It was plain, that he could not endure the Eye of his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52508:308"/> Father upon him; and he thought himſelf happy, that the Old Man with his Gravity was ſo far off removed.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, <hi>Aemilian</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> Revolted, and ſet up for himſelf as Emperor, and ſeized upon the Granaries and the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of that Country, till ſeveral Towns there were almoſt laid under a Famine. Againſt him <hi>Theodotus,</hi> a General of <hi>Gallienus,</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fought him and took him, and ſent him alive to the Emperor his Maſter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gallienus</hi> ſtill perſiſting in his Sports and his Luxury, and no better looking after the Publick Weal, than a Boy that is made a King in a Play of a Company of Boys. The <hi>Gauls,</hi> to whom it is Natural to be Light, and a People that cannot contain themſelves under Princes, which are luxurious and which degenerate from that <hi>Roman</hi> Valour, which did at firſt ſubject them, called <hi>Poſthumius</hi> to the Empire; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Forces of that Province conſented, who were very ſenſible, and accordingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the ſlavery of <hi>Gallienus</hi> to his Luſts. Againſt <hi>Poſthumius,</hi> marched <hi>Gallienus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Body of Troops. He beſieged <hi>Poſthumius</hi> in the City where he was: But as he was viewing the Walls, the <hi>Gauls</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd him, and gave him a Wound by the ſhot of an Arrow. <hi>Poſthumius</hi> reigned ſeven Years in <hi>Gallia,</hi> and aſſerted that Country bravely againſt the Incurſions of all the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> round about. The War betwixt <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus</hi> and him was long protracted, through a number of Sieges and Battels: Sometimes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52508:308"/> the one, ſometimes the other carried it: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Gallienus</hi> was obliged by the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which beſet him, to make a Peace with the pretended Emperor <hi>Aureolus,</hi> for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunity of oppoſing <hi>Poſthumius.</hi> To<note place="margin">Many Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Wars.</note> theſe Miſchiefs, the <hi>Scythians</hi> invaded the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Bithynia</hi> in the Leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed whole Towns there. They came up to the City of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and burnt it and grievouſly laid it waſte. Beſides which, as if all the World conſpired at once to afflict us, in <hi>Sicily</hi> there aroſe as it were a ſervile War, by the means of a company of Robbers, that roved up and down, and required a great deal of pains to ſuppreſs them. All theſe things happened out of a Contempt of <hi>Gallienus:</hi> becauſe there is nothing which gives ſo much Boldneſs to the Wicked, nor ſo much Hopes and Encouragement to the Good, as when either on the one hand a Good Prince is feared, or on the other a Diſſolute Prince is deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt ſo many Commotions and Wars, an Earthquake in the Year when <hi>Gallienus</hi> and<note place="margin">A dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</note> 
                        <hi>Fauſtinianus</hi> were the Conſuls, in a violent manner ſhook the Cities of <hi>Aſia;</hi> it ſhook <hi>Libya,</hi> and the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and there was a Darkneſs for ſeveral days. The roaring of the Earth from beneath, was like the Voice of Thunder from above. Many Fabricks were conſumed in this Earthquake, and their Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants with them, and others killed with the fright. The Earth opened in abundance of places, and ſalt Water came up into the Breaches, and ſeveral Cities were covered with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52508:309"/> a Flood of Waters. Above all, it did the moſt miſchief in <hi>Aſia.</hi> At the ſame time ſo great a Peſtilence raged at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Cities of <hi>Achaia,</hi> that five thouſand Perſons died of it in one day. So the Books of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> were Inſpected, and the Peace of the Gods begged and ſought into, and a Sacrifice was offered to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Author of Health, according as it was preſcribed by the ſaid Books of the <hi>Sibyls.</hi> Fortune raged on all ſides. Here the Earth ſhook and trembled; there it gaped and opened;<note place="margin">The many Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the Times.</note> in other Parts a Peſtilence laid us waſte; <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> in the mean time a Captive, <hi>Gallia</hi> diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Wars of <hi>Poſthumius,</hi> and the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> the Eaſt under the Empire of <hi>Odenatus, Aureolus</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and <hi>Aemilian</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Egypt; Thrace</hi> taken up betwixt the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> who laid waſte <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi> and beſieged <hi>Theſſalonica:</hi> No moderate degree of quiet had we on any ſide. And all this in a great meaſure, as I have ſaid, was yet occaſioned by the Contempt, in which <hi>Gallienus</hi> was with all the World: which he drew upon himſelf by his exceſſive Luxury; and not only that, but he was a Man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if he was out of Danger, was fit enough for all kind of Wickedneſs. In <hi>Achaia, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi> with the Forces of <hi>Gallienus,</hi> Engaged the <hi>Goths,</hi> and obliged them to retire. The <hi>Scythians,</hi> who are another part of the <hi>Goths,</hi> at the ſame time laid waſte <hi>Aſia,</hi> and plundered and burnt the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Fame of the Riches whereof is ſo well known to all the Earth.</p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:52508:309"/>
                     <p>It is a ſhame almoſt to ſay, what Expreſſions, what Jeſts, came upon theſe occaſions from the mouth of <hi>Gallienus,</hi> when he was told of the Revolt and Troubles of this and the other Place. <hi>Egypt,</hi> it was told him, was Revolted: And what then, ſays he, cannot we be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Flax of <hi>Egypt? Aſia,</hi> it was told him, was laid waſte, both by the Earthquakes, and the <hi>Scythian</hi> Enemy. What then, ſays he, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not we be without Salt-petre? When <hi>Galliá</hi> was loſt to <hi>Poſthumius,</hi> he laughed and ſaid; Cannot the State be ſafe, unleſs we have our Stuffs from <hi>Arras?</hi> And ſo of all Parts of the World, when he had loſt them, he Jeſted, and was no more concerned, than for his old Cloaths, or the loſs of any vile Slave.</p>
                     <p>And that nothing which is Ill, ſhould be wanting to his Times, the City of <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> which is the Key of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and famous for its Naval Powers, was rendred total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſolate by the Soldiers of the ſame <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that ſcarce any body was left alive in it. There is no Antient Family to be found now there, to repreſent the Nobility and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of its former People, but what perhaps hath ſprung from ſome Perſon or other, who eſcaped the ſlaughter, by being at that time abſent on his buſineſs, or in the ſervice of the War.</p>
                     <p>After the Peace with <hi>Aureolus, Gallienus,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of him and <hi>Claudius</hi> as his General, who was afterwards Emperor, and who is the Head of the Family of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the <hi>Caeſar,</hi> began the War afreſh againſt <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humius</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:52508:310"/> in <hi>Gallia. Poſthumius</hi> was aſſiſted with many ſuccours from the <hi>Celtae</hi> and the <hi>Franks;</hi> and being joined by <hi>Victorinus,</hi> whom he had made Partner with him in his pretended Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, he marched to the Battel againſt <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> They fought ſeveral times with variety of ſucceſs on both ſides. The Victory at laſt<note place="margin">Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</hi>
                        </note> fell to <hi>Gallienus;</hi> who, it is to be owned, had ſudden Valour, which came hot upon him, when he was in a Choler and well provoked.</p>
                     <p>In this Choler he went next to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of <hi>Byzantium;</hi> where he did not expect to be received within the Walls. But upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, he was. The day after, he firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, and then put all the Garriſon and Town in cold blood to the Sword, contrary to his Faith and the Promiſes that he had made them. About the ſame time the <hi>Scythians</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> were beaten by the Valour and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders there, and obliged to retire from their Incurſions.</p>
                     <p>Winged with theſe Succeſſes, <hi>Gallienus</hi> flew<note place="margin">Gallienus <hi>his return to</hi> Rome.</note> with great ſpeed to <hi>Rome;</hi> and Convocating the Senate, he Inſtituted and Celebrated his <hi>Decennial</hi> Games, the Pomp and the Pleaſures whereof, were as Exquiſite as they were New. He went to the Capitol, in a Proceſſion of the Senators in their Robes, the Gentry, the Soldiers clad in White, all the People, Slaves a very great many, and Women marching before with Wax Tapers and Lamps in their hands. Theſe were preceded by a hundred white Oxen, yoaked two and two, with their Horns gilt, and Cloths of Silk thrown over
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52508:310"/> their Backs of divers Colours, which made a great Show. In like manner, marched two hundred pure white Lambs: Ten Elephants, that were then at <hi>Rome:</hi> One thouſand two hundred Gladiators, pompouſly dreſſed in Cloaths embroider'd with Gold, ſuch as the Ladies of Quality wear: Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tam'd Wild Beaſts of ſeveral kinds, very finely adorned; Chariots full of Mimicks, and all ſorts of Players; Pugils fighting, but not with true, but counterfeit Weapons; Drolls playing the Anticks, and others imitating the Geſtures and Looks of the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> which was wonderful. All the Streets reſounded with Acclamations, and the Plays, and the Noiſe. In the midſt, amongſt the Senators, marched <hi>Gallienus</hi> himſelf in a Triumphal Gown and Tunick, accompanied with all the Prieſts in their Robes. There were five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Spears of Gold born on each ſide, one hundred Standards, the Standards of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Prieſts, the Arms and Enſigns of the Temples, and all the Legions. Then went alſo ſeparate Bodies of Men, repreſenting Captives of Vanquiſh'd Nations: as <hi>Goths, Sarmatians, Franks</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of no leſs than two hundred in a Body. And with this Pomp did <hi>Gallienus</hi> vainly think to elude and put upon the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> who nevertheleſs ſeeing through the diſguiſe, one Man favoured <hi>Poſthumius,</hi> another <hi>Regil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> another <hi>Aureolus,</hi> another <hi>Aemilian,</hi> and another <hi>Saturninus,</hi> as they fancied. Great lamentation was made for the Captivity of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52508:311"/> 
                        <hi>Valerian,</hi> the Father; and it was admired, that his own Son ſhould leave him ſo unrevenged, when ſtrangers and foreign Potentates had been ready to vindicate him. But nothing of this moved <hi>Gallienus,</hi> his heart was ſtupified with his Pleaſures. All his diſcourſe to thoſe that were about him, was, What have we for Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? What are the Diverſions that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to day? What will be the Play to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? What are the Races to be run in the Cirque? The Proceſſion being over, and the Hecatombs being offered to the Gods, <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> returned to the Court, where there was an Entertainment: which when finiſhed, he appointed the other days for the publick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes. One thing I muſt not omit, and that is an unlucky Jeſt, which was made upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Amongſt the pretended Captives, which were ridiculouſly led in Triumph, there was a Body of ſuppoſed <hi>Perſians.</hi> As this Body was marching, ſome Drolls, that had a mind to be pleaſant, came in amongſt them and ſought, and look'd all about, and viewed every ones Face, and wondred, and were very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive; till at laſt they were asked, what they would have? and what was it they wanted? Say they, we would ſee the Emperor's Father. This coming to the ears of <hi>Gallienus,</hi> no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard either to his Father, or to Pity, or his own ſhame could prevail with him, but he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Men to be burnt. The People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their deaths, beyond expectation, very ill; and the Soldiers worſe: who were ſo troubled, that they reveng'd it upon <hi>Gallienus</hi> himſelf, not long after.</p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:52508:311"/>
                     <p>In the Year that <hi>Gallienus</hi> and <hi>Saturninus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

He preſently poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Cities of <hi>Niſibis</hi> and <hi>Charrae,</hi> by the Surrender of the Inhabitants, who blamed <hi>Gallienus</hi> for his Neglect. Yet was not <hi>Odena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> wanting in his Reſpect to <hi>Gallienus</hi> neither. He ſent the Great Men of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whom he took Priſoners, to <hi>Rome</hi> to him, to give him the opportunity of inſulting over their Miſery in their turn: which he did in a Triumph, though the Victory was not his own, but <hi>Ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>'s; and ſtill he mentioned nothing of his Father; nor upon the report which came of his Death, but, which proved afterwards falſe, did he Deifie him, till he was conſtrained to it. <hi>Odenatus</hi> advanced to the City of <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> and beſieged it, with a multitude of the <hi>Perſians</hi> therein. He laid all the Country about waſte, and killed innumerable of the Enemy. All the Great Men of the <hi>Perſians</hi> out of all the Provinces flew to this Siege, for the common defence. They Fought. Fortune was a long time various, and the Victory hard in getting. But however it fell at laſt on the ſide of <hi>Ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus;</hi> who as he had no other end in the War, but to deliver <hi>Valerian,</hi> ſo he daily puſhed for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52508:312"/> it, but the Circumſtances of Places in a ſtrange Country, incumbred the good Prince with great difficulties.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> broke in into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which they Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaged: and having made themſelves Maſters of ſome Towns, after the War was a long time doubtful, they withdrew from thence into <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia.</hi> Therefore the Soldiers were at this time for chooſing another Perſon Emperor: whom when <hi>Gallienus</hi> could not pacifie in his favour, he killed them all, which was his way, as he did at <hi>Byzantium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ill as his Affairs on all ſides ſtood, <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> proſecuted his Vanities. He deſired to be made a Citizen and Preſident of <hi>Athens,</hi> and to be admitted to all the Religious Rites of that place, and to be made one of the number of the <hi>Areopagites.</hi> This was a Contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Honours which he enjoy'd from thence; as if he valued it more to be an <hi>Areopagite</hi> and the <hi>Archon</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> than to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor. It is true, that both <hi>Hadrian</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to be initiated in the <hi>Eleuſinian</hi> Rites. But the Emperor <hi>Hadrian</hi> was, when he did it, in the height of his proſperity; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Antoninus</hi> did not affect it, till after a firm Peace; and both of them were ſo well ſeen in the Greek Learning, that ſeldom were the learnedeſt Doctors there, ſuperiour to them,<note place="margin">His Skill in the Arts.</note> in the judgment of the Great Men. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied indeed, but <hi>Gallienus</hi> was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Oratory, Poetry, and all the Arts.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52508:312"/> He made an Epithalamium upon the Marriage of his Brother's Sons, <hi>extempore,</hi> which was better than a hundred others, made at the ſame time by all the Greek and Latin Poets, though they ſtudied ſeveral days upon it, and every one did his beſt to excel. The Epithalamium of <hi>Gallienus</hi> was theſe three Lines. Taking them by the Hands,</p>

Where there is Forage for the purpoſe, there he ſends his Horſe; where Corn, there he places the Foot. He compels no Man, no Landlord to find Corn there, where he hath it not; nor to feed a Horſe, where he cannot. And it is certainly the beſt way to take things as they grow upon the place without charging the Publick with Carriages and Expences. Thus the Province of <hi>Galatia</hi> abounds in Corn; <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Illyricum</hi> are full of Corn, let the Foot be quartered there. In <hi>Thrace,</hi> the Horſe alſo might Winter very well, without damage to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, becauſe the Fields afford a great deal of Graſs: So where there is plenty of Bacon, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commodities, the beſt way is, to raiſe and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſaid Commodities from thence.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52508:336"/> the <hi>Goths,</hi> ſhe continued her Reign longer, than it was otherwiſe ſufferable in one of her Sex.

I can ſay, that it was through her means, that <hi>Odenatus</hi> overcame the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and putting to flight King <hi>Sapores,</hi> advanced his Arms as far as to the City of <hi>Cteſiphon.</hi> I can aſſure you, that this Woman was ſo great a Terror to the Eaſt, and to the People of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that neither the <hi>Arabians,</hi> nor the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi> nor the <hi>Saracens</hi> dared to move for her. Nor had I preſerved to her, her life, but that I know, that ſhe did great ſervice even by her very Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe ſhe kept up and aſſerted the Bounds of the Empire. Let them therefore, who are pleaſed with nothing, take the Poiſon of their own Tongues

If it is not Handſome to have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and Triumphed over a Woman, what ſhall I ſay of the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> that Good and Venerable Commander, who had done the ſame, if he had not been wholly taken up with his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions againſt the <hi>Goths.</hi> He Privately and Prudently ſuffered her to Reign, to give himſelf the greater opportunity of effecting what he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, whilſt ſhe preſerved inviolate the antient Bounds of the Empire of the Eaſt.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Zenobia</hi> was a Lady of that Chaſtity, that ſhe never accompanied with her Husband, more than to attempt a Conception. For after ſhe had lain with him, ſhe contained, and expected her Terms, to know whether ſhe was with Child: If ſhe was not, then ſhe gave way to the Repetition. She lived with the Pomp of a Queen, but much according to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mode. She was Adored after the manner of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and her manner of Eating was like theirs. But ſhe went to Harangue her Soldiers, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors do, with a Helmet upon her Head, and an Imperial Robe of Purple upon her Back, buttoned with a Jewel, and Jewels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Borders, and ſhe ſhew'd one Arm ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times bare. She was of a Brown Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, Black Eyes which were incomparably lively and glittering, a Divine <hi>Eſprit,</hi> a moſt delicate Shape and Preſence: her Teeth ſo bright, one would think them rather to be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52508:337"/> Pearls: a Clear and Manly Voice. She had the Severity of a Tyrant, when neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and all the Clemency of a good Prince, where there was occaſion for her Goodneſs. Her Generoſity was ruled by Prudence. She managed her Publick Treaſure with a care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Conduct of her Sex. She uſed a Coach, ſeldom a Litter, but often rode a Horſe; and ſhe walked often on Foot, it is ſaid, three or four Miles together. She was born with the Tenaciouſneſs of a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> A ſober Woman, yet ſhe made no ſcruple fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to drink with the great Officers of her Army; and alſo with <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> whom in her Table ſhe excelled. The Veſſels for her Table were of Gold, beſet with Jewels. Eunuchs advanced in years ſerved her; very ſeldom Women. She obliged her Sons to ſpeak in Latin; they rarely or hardly at all ſpoke <hi>Greek.</hi> Nor was ſhe altogether ignorant of Latin herſelf; but her modeſty for fear of not doing it well, forbad her to ſpeak it. She ſpoke the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Language perfectly well. It is ſaid, ſhe had Epitomized the <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> and the Oriental Hiſtories, ſhe was ſo well acquainted in them; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory ſhe had Read in the <hi>Greek.</hi> When therefore ſhe was taken and brought into the Preſence of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> O <hi>Zenobia,</hi> ſaid <hi>Aurelian</hi> to her, why have you dared to Inſult, as you have done, the Emperors of <hi>Rome?</hi> ſhe anſwered, I know you to be an Emperor, who are a Conqueror. But I have not thought <hi>Gallienus,</hi> nor <hi>Aureolus,</hi> or thoſe others to be ſo; and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52508:338"/> believing that <hi>Victorina</hi> might be ſuch another as my ſelf, I deſired, if it was poſſible, that ſhe and I might ſhare the Empire betwixt us.</p>
                        <p>She was led in Solemn Triumph at <hi>Rome,</hi> in that manner, that nothing ever appeared more Pompous, and with that Grace, in the Eyes of that City. She laboured under the Burden of her Ornaments. She had ſuch great Jewels upon her, that though ſhe was a ſtrong Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe ſtopt many times, and cried, ſhe could not go on for their Weight. Upon her Feet and Hands, ſhe had Chains of Gold; and about her Neck a Chain of Gold, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by one of her old Guards, a <hi>Perſian. Aurelian</hi> gave her her life; which ſhe ſpent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with her Children at <hi>Tivoli,</hi> in the Quality, and according to the uſage of a <hi>Roman</hi> Matron: an Eſtate was given her there for her ſupport, near the Palace of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and the ſame carries her name at this day.</p>

                              <hi>TItus,</hi> as both <hi>Dexippus, Herodian,</hi> and all Hiſtorians write, was a Tribune of the <hi>Moors,</hi> whom <hi>Maximin</hi> had diſmiſt from his Service.

After all theſe Honours, as he lived an old Man upon his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, he was taken out by the Soldiers, and made Emperor, which was under the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Claudius.</hi> Thoſe who jeſted upon him, called him alſo a <hi>Claudius;</hi> becauſe of his <hi>halting,</hi> from <hi>Claudico,</hi> to Halt. In ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days afterwards, from his Elevation, the ſame Perſons that had raiſed him, killed him; they thought he was too ſtrict, and of too ſevere a Diſcipline for them. His Sepulchre ſtands about the City of <hi>Bologna,</hi> where in great Letters are written upon it all his Honours, concluding with this; <hi>Happy in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, but an Emperor.</hi> His Family, who are yet Extant, and famous by the name of

Nor can I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe this piece of Service to the Memory of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52508:342"/> ſo great a Prince. For ſince I have already given my ſelf the trouble of writing upon thoſe Tumultuary Reigns, and ſuch Petty Kings as the Thirty foregoing, and upon the Actions alſo of <hi>Zenobia</hi> and <hi>Victorina</hi> two Women; the Condition of Affairs under the Emperor <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus</hi> coming to that paſs, that even the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as well as Men Uſurped upon him; It would be a Crime in me to chooſe to be ſilent of a Prince, who was Great Uncle to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Caeſar, and who by his Bravery over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Goths,</hi> and put an end to the publick Calamities of the State: who, though not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Author of the Deſign againſt <hi>Gallienus,</hi> yet for the Publick Good, was made an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our deliverance from that Prodigy of an Emperor; and had he lived long upon the Throne, he had revived to us by his Virtues; his Counſels, and his Conduct, the <hi>Scipios,</hi> and the <hi>Camillus,</hi> and all thoſe Noble <hi>Romans</hi> of Antient Times.</p>
                     <p>His Reign was ſhort. But yet the ſame would have been thought of it, though he had attained to the greateſt Age. Every thing in him was Admirable, every thing in him was Conſpicuous, and to be preferred even before the moſt Triumphant Actions of the Antients. He had the Bravery of <hi>Trajan,</hi> the Piety of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> the Moderation of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the Excellencies of all the Great Princes in that manner, that inſtead of taking an Example by others, had thoſe Princes never been, his ſingle Example had been enough for all the World. The Learned in the matter of Nativities are of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52508:342"/> an Opinion, that one hundred and twenty Years is the greateſt Age given to a Man to live; and more, they pretend, hath not been permitted to any; only to <hi>Moſes</hi> the Friend of God, as the Books of the Jews ſpeak, who attained unto one hundred and twenty five Years: And when he complained that he died, whilſt as yet he had all his Senſes intire and vigorous, it was anſwer'd him, by I know not what Deity, that no Perſon was to live above that Age. Now had <hi>Claudius</hi> lived to one hundred and twenty Years, though his Death muſt have of neceſſity proceeded at that time, yet would no body have deſired it then, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks concerning <hi>Scipio,</hi> becauſe his Life was ſtupendous and admirable. Take him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Home or Abroad, and what is there, that is Great, that he did not diſcover? He Loved his Parents, ſhall I ſay? He Loved his Brothers, and this is no Miracle. He Loved his Relations, a thing which is in our times to be compared unto a Miracle. He Envied no one: The Wicked he puniſhed. Corrupt Magiſtrates he openly and publickly Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He overlook'd the Indiſcretions of Fools. He made excellent Laws. He was that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon the Throne, that thoſe of his Race have been ſince Courted to the Empire by the greateſt Princes, and are dear in the beſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Senate.</p>
                     <p>I may be thought perhaps to ſpeak this in flattery to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the Caeſar. But I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal as well to the Conſcience of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, as to my Manner of Life, to be my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52508:343"/> Whether I have ever thought, or uttered, or acted any thing at any time, that is of that Nature. I have before my eyes the Emperor <hi>Claudius;</hi> whoſe Life, Probity, and all the Actions of his Reign have given ſuch a Fame of him to Poſterity, that both the Senate and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> conferred upon him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Honours, after his Death. A Shield in Gold, wherein is engraven his Image, was by the Voice of the whole Senate, ſet up in his Honour in the Houſe of the Senate, where it is extant at this day. The People of <hi>Rome</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Honours done to him by the People of</hi> Rome,</note> (which never was done before) at their own expence, ſet up his Statue of Gold of the heighth of ten Foot in the Capitol, before the Temple of the moſt High and Excellent <hi>Jupiter:</hi> In the Publick Forum was his Statue in Silver, in a Triumphal Robe, erected upon a Column, with the Acclamations of all Mankind; the Silver being of one thouſand and five hundred pound weight. As if he had a proſpect of things future, he revived and propagated the Honour of the Family of the <hi>Flavii,</hi> of which was <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> not to mention <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> becauſe he was one unworthy of it. In a ſhort time he finiſhed the War with the <hi>Goths.</hi> So that if I muſt be thought to Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Senate, the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Foreign World, and the Provinces are all Flatterers with me.

                     <p>It is fit for all the World, but eſpecially thoſe who would imitate the Examples of good Princes to know, with what Acclamations and Affection the Senate received this Prince: and in the Voice of the Senate, one may ſee in a manner the Senſe of Mankind. The News came to them of his Elevation, upon the Ninth of the Kalends of <hi>April,</hi> which is the Feſtival of <hi>Cybele,</hi> whilſt they were in the Chappel of that Goddeſs. But they could not perſwade themſelves to continue longer there, to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Duties of the Day.

                     <p>The firſt Action of <hi>Claudius,</hi> after his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Empire, was his Victory over <hi>Aureolus,</hi> who had made himſelf the more troubleſome, becauſe he was much in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Gallienus. Claudius</hi> fought him, and defeated him, and publiſhed Edicts to the People, and ſent Letters to the Senate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declared him, upon his refuſal ſtill to ſubmit himſelf, an Uſurper. <hi>Aureolus</hi> deſired a Treaty of Accommodation with him: But<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Claudius</hi> was deaf to that Motion, and told him very gravely, that he was not a <hi>Gallienus</hi> to be ask'd ſuch a thing, who might comply with him, becauſe he feared him. At length <hi>Aureolus</hi> was killed by the Soldiers at <hi>Milan,</hi> and received that End which his Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners deſerved. Some Hiſtorians ridiculouſly endeavour to Commend him. <hi>Gallus Antipater</hi> calls him a <hi>Golden Emperor;</hi> as if he was the better Man, becauſe his Name in the Latin refers to the word <hi>Aurum</hi> or Gold. But as that Writer is the Father of Flatterers, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Hiſtorians, ſo I have often known the Name of <hi>Aureolus</hi> given to a Good Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and your Majeſty's Book of the Publick Sports hath this very Name in the Liſt of the Names of the Gladiators. But to return to <hi>Claudius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Goths,</hi> that had made a ſhift to eſcape home from the Army of <hi>Martianus,</hi> as we have ſaid before in the Life of <hi>Gallienus</hi> I. excited at their arrival, all the Nations and People of their Confederacy, to fall to make Depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Lands of the Empire.

Eſpecially he was ſo tedious with the Preparations that he was making for this <hi>Gothick</hi> War, to conclude the ſame effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as he ought, that he tryed, as it were, the utmoſt Patience of the Fates: And yet I think, that this really redounded the more to his Glory, and made his Conqueſt the more Illuſtrious in the Eye of all the World.

                     <p>The ſame Enemy had with them beſides this, two thouſand Sail of Shipping; which is double the number of all the <hi>Grecian</hi> and the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Fleet, that heretofore went againſt <hi>Troy</hi> and the other Cities of <hi>Aſia.</hi> And yet the Fictions of the Poet have magnified that too: whereas this that I ſpeak of, is the very Matter of Fact.

                     <p>I cannot but deplore the Misfortune of the Reign of <hi>Gallienus,</hi> and the Condition of the State under ſix hundred Uſurpers, that ſet up themſelves againſt him. Had thoſe Soldiers and thoſe Leigions all been ſafe, which were ſo unhappily loſt in the ſeveral Battels fought betwixt <hi>Gallienus</hi> and his Adverſaries, what an addition of Strength would it have been to the Empire? It is to be aſcribed to <hi>Claudius,</hi> that the Honour of the Arms of the Empire was retrieved after ſo publick a Loſs. He had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Battels with the Enemy in the Province of <hi>Moeſia,</hi> and before the City of <hi>Marcianopoli</hi> in <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and divers of their Kings were taken, and Noble Women of divers Nations, and great numbers of others periſhed in the Rivers. The <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces were filled with <hi>Gothick</hi> Slaves, who were employed to Till the Ground. No Town or Quarter but could ſhew you <hi>Goths,</hi> acquired by the Triumph of our Arms. What Foreign <hi>Barbarian</hi> Cattle did our Anceſtors then ſee? what Sheep? what Horſe? All this redounds to the Glory of <hi>Claudius,</hi> who at once ſecured, and infinitely enriched the Empire.<note place="margin">His ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> He fought the Enemy at <hi>Byzantium;</hi> the People there, as many as had eſcaped the bloody
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52508:346"/> Hands of the Soldiers of <hi>Gallienus</hi> bravely aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. He fought them at the City of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had laid Siege to in his abſence. He fought them in divers Countries, and every where beat them. One would almoſt think, that he had a Preſcience of his future Kinſman <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> the <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that he was ſettling the Empire in ſafety for him againſt his Reign.</p>
                     <p>This brings it to my mind to ſay, that <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> was indeed foretold by the Oracles which he conſulted, and the Lots that he drew, not only of his own Elevation, but that others of his Race ſhould come to the Empire after him. He conſulted alſo about his Brother <hi>Quintillus;</hi> becauſe he was willing to take him to be his Colleague in the Empire. But he was anſwer'd ſo, as to ſignifie, that <hi>Quintillus</hi> had not long to live. And I have the rather inſerted this, becauſe it ſhews, that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the <hi>Caeſar</hi> who is of the Blood of <hi>Claudius,</hi> was foreſeen and prognoſticated ſo long ago as in the Reign of his Great Uncle; and conſequently he is a Perſon of a Divine Appointment, of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Family, and we may hope for many Princes to deſcend from him: which I preſume to offer at leaſt with all due ſubmiſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their Majeſties, <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> and to <hi>Galerius</hi> his Brother, to whom I wiſh all Health.</p>
                     <p>During the time that <hi>Claudius</hi> was managing the War againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Palmyreni</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> under the Arms of <hi>Sabas,</hi> or <hi>Zabdas,</hi> and <hi>Timagenes,</hi> made War upon the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:52508:347"/> The <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who are an obſtinate and an indefatigable People in War, defeated them, but with the loſs of <hi>Probus</hi> their General, who was killed by the Arts of <hi>Timagenes.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> after this, ſubmitted themſelves all to the Obedience of the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and accordingly ſwore Fealty to <hi>Claudius,</hi> though he was not then preſent with them.</p>
                     <p>In the Year of the Conſulſhips of <hi>Atticianus</hi> and <hi>Orphitus,</hi> the very Heavens ſignally aſſiſted the War of <hi>Claudius.</hi> A great multitude of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that were yet remaining, had fled for refuge to the Mountain <hi>Haemus,</hi> and the adjoyning Province in <hi>Thrace.</hi> But they were ſo diſtreſſed there with a Famine and a Peſtilence, that their own Calamities antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated the Work of our Arms; nor would <hi>Claudius</hi> give them that honour to Conquer them in the Condition they then were. Thus this fierce War ended, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Name was eaſed of thoſe Terrors with which it was threatned in the beginning. One thing the Truth obliges me to obſerve; that ſuch, as think we Flatter, may know that we conceal nothing, which it is requiſite, that a Hiſtory ſhould publiſh. Once after a full Victory that <hi>Claudius</hi> had received of the Enemy, his Men, grown careleſs with the Succeſs, which is apt to diſorder the wiſeſt Heads, fell ſo to Plunder, that they forgat all thoughts and fears of the Enemy. Therefore a Party of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that had fled, returning unexpectedly again upon them, whilſt they were yet ingaged whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Plundering, cut off of them two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52508:347"/> But as ſoon as <hi>Claudius</hi> ſaw it, he drew up his Troops, and took all that Party of the Enemy Priſoners, and laid them in Irons, and ſent them to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be kept for the bloody Purpoſe of the Fights of the Gladiators. So <hi>Claudius</hi> with his good Conduct retrieved that Miſcarriage of his Men, or rather that Blow of Fortune; and the Enemy by their Stratagem only heightened his Victory, and their own ruine.</p>
                     <p>In this War the <hi>Dalmatick</hi> Horſe ſignaliz'd themſelves much. <hi>Claudius</hi> himſelf hath been ſometime thought to derive his Origin from their Country; though others make him a <hi>Trojan,</hi> and pretend to bring him down even from <hi>Ilus</hi> and <hi>Dardanus,</hi> the two moſt Antient Kings of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Enemy had in this War, thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Iſland of <hi>Crete,</hi> and attempted to lay waſte that of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But their Army every where labouring under Sickneſs, they were likewiſe eaſily reduced there.</p>
                     <p>Then, the <hi>Gothick</hi> War being finiſhed, and the general Sickneſs raging more and more, <hi>Claudius</hi> fell ſick of the ſame and died, and the<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Death of</hi> Claudins.</note> Heavens received him, to whom his Virtues ſo particularly allyed him.</p>
                     <p>After his death, his Brother <hi>Quintillus</hi> with univerſal Conſent aſcended the Empire: Not as if it was by Inheritance; but he was preferred to it for his deſerts. He was ſo good a Perſon, and ſo truly, as I may ſay, in Virtue, his Brother's Brother, that he would have been made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, though he had never had that Relation by
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52508:348"/> Blood. Under him the <hi>Barbarians</hi> that yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, laid waſte the City of <hi>Kenkis</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and attempted <hi>Nigeboli</hi> in <hi>Bulgaria:</hi> but they were defeated and ſuppreſſed again by the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of thoſe of the Country. His Reign was ſo ſhort, that he had not the time to be Maſter of any great Action. The Soldiers killed him,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Having given this Account of the Military part of <hi>Claudius,</hi> I ſhould be wanting to the Reader, if I did not in the next place ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve<note place="margin">

He did this once, when he was a young Man, Wreſtling with the ſtrongeſt there in the <hi>Field of Mars,</hi> at the Publick Exerciſes of the Soldiers, the Party with whom he Wreſtled, giving him a twiſt by the Cods, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, <hi>Claudius</hi> in a paſſion lift up his Hand, and ſtruck out all his Teeth at once. The Emperor <hi>Decius</hi> was then preſent; who, it not being an Action to be puniſhed, becauſe it ſhew'd both the Bravery and the Modeſty of <hi>Claudius,</hi> commended him rather publickly for it, and preſented him with the Collars and Bracelets, and ordered him to Wreſtle no more, to avoid further occaſions of Quarrel. He left no Children: <hi>Quintillus</hi> left two, and <hi>Criſpus,</hi> as I ſaid, one Daughter.</p>
                     <p>What an opinion the Emperors <hi>Valerian, Decius,</hi> and <hi>Gallienus</hi> had of <hi>Claudius,</hi> whilſt he was their Subject: and the probability that then appeared of his future Elevation, we may ſee in theſe following Letters.</p>

                     <p>UPON the Feſtival of the Goddeſs <hi>Cybele,</hi> which is a time that with us we know is very pleaſant, and full of all Mirth and Freedom both in our Words and Actions; the honourable the Governour of the City of <hi>Rome, Junius Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berianus,</hi>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52508:352"/> Chariot from the Palace to the Gardens of <hi>Varius;</hi> and as his Mind was then at eaſe, and free from the Cares and the Thoughts of the publick Affairs, he did me the Honour to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me with a great many things, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about the Lives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Paſſing by the Temple of the Sun, which had been built by the Emperor <hi>Aurelian,</hi> from whom <hi>Junius Tiberianus</hi> derived in part his own Blood and Family, he ask'd me, what Perſon had writ the Life of that Prince; I told him, I had read his Hiſtory by ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, but never by any <hi>Roman.</hi> At which he ſighed and ſaid, <hi>Amongſt the Antients, not a</hi> Therſites <hi>nor a</hi> Sinon, <hi>nor any remarkable, tho' a monſtrous ſort of a Man appeared, but we, know him very well, and his Character is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Poſterity. And ſhall the Memory of ſo renowned and ſo incomparable a Prince, as</hi> Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian <hi>be forgotten, by whom the whole World was regained to the Obedience of the</hi> Romans? <hi>God deliver us from this folly! If I miſtake not, we have a Journal of this Prince by us, and his Wars digeſted in a due order of Hiſtory. I would wiſh that you would take them and conſider them, and add the things to them that you find rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his Life. I will promiſe to furniſh you with that Journal, out of the</hi> Ulpian <hi>Library. You will ſee, it contains almoſt all things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him; becauſe it is a Book in which the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of every day, as they happened, were ſet down by his own eſpecial Order. So I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to repreſent him to the World, juſtly as he was, to your Power.</hi>

                     <p>I ſubmitted to what the Governour ſaid and commanded me, and I furniſhed my ſelf both with the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtorians, and all things elſe neceſſary to my purpoſe, out of which I have compiled according to the beſt of my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his ſmall Treatiſe which I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make a Preſent of, Sir, to you.

                     <p>We had ſome Diſcourſe, whilſt we were in the ſame Chariot together, concerning <hi>Trebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Pollio,</hi> who hath written an Account of all the Emperors, whether of famous or of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Note, from the Two <hi>Philips</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Claudius</hi> and his Brother <hi>Quintillus.</hi> The Governour ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Trebellius Pollio <hi>had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ſeveral things without due care, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too ſhort.</hi> To which I made him anſwer, <hi>That there is no Writer of Hiſtory, but what hath his Miſtakes in one kind or other.</hi> I ſhew'd him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in what <hi>Livy,</hi> in what <hi>Saluſt,</hi> in what <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> in what <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> are evidently miſtaken, and proved to be ſo.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52508:353"/> of Men place his Birth there. Some give him to the Province of <hi>Dacia Ripenſis;</hi> and one Author I remember I have read, that makes him to be born in <hi>Moeſia.</hi> As it often happens in Perſons, who raiſe themſelves ſo from a low Birth, that the true place of their Nativity is unknown; and in the mean time others are deviſed or diſſembled for them, which may ſeem to reflect upon them a greater Honour. However, it is not a matter of ſuch moment to know of a great Prince where he was born; as what ſignalized him, and made him great. Do we admire <hi>Plato</hi> becauſe he was born at <hi>Athens,</hi> or becauſe he was ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and ſo illuſtrious a Philoſopher? Or are <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Zeno,</hi> the leſs becauſe they were born in the little Villages of <hi>Stagira</hi> and <hi>Elea?</hi> Or is <hi>Anacharſis</hi> the meaner, becauſe he was a <hi>Scythian</hi> born? When the Merits of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of all theſe have every where raiſed their Fame to the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aurelian</hi> was born of an obſcure Family, and mean Parents. He had a great vivacity of Wit from his firſt Years. He was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſtrong of Body, and never paſſed a Day, though it was a Holy-day, and a time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reſt, without exerciſing himſelf at the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin, the Arrow, and other Arms. <hi>Callicrates Tyrius,</hi> who is one of the moſt Learned <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Writers, ſays, that the Mother of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was a Prieſteſs of the Temple of the Sun, in that Village where ſhe and her Husband lived, and that ſhe had ſomething of the Power of Divination in her; particularly once revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52508:353"/> the follies of her Husband, and his low Condition, ſhe ſaid to him, <hi>You, the Father of an Emperor!</hi> As if ſhe had a preſcience of <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s being hereafter an Emperor; which yet further he: ſays, was predicted by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tokens. A Serpent came and incircled<note place="margin">Omens of his future Reign.</note> it ſelf often about the Veſſel, in which he was waſhed; nor would his Mother, when ſhe ſaw it, ſuffer it to be killed, but made much of it; and it eſcaped the Attempts that were made by any to kill it. The Emperor then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having made an Offering to the Temple of the Sun, where <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Mother was a Prieſteſs, of a Cloak of Purple, ſhe took it and cut into Swathing Cloaths for her Child. At the ſame time ſhe had a Calf born of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful bigneſs, white, ſpotted with purple, and upon his Skin, on the one ſide, was the figure of a Crown; on the other, the word <hi>Ave,</hi> that is, <hi>Hail;</hi> a Salutation given to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. The before-mentioned <hi>Callicrates Tyrius</hi> produces many more Omens, which I ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, becauſe I think them ſuperfluous. When <hi>Aurelian</hi> was ſent Embaſſador into <hi>Perſia,</hi> he was preſented there with a piece of Plate of the like ſort as the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> are uſed to preſent to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and upon it was engraved the Sun, in the ſame form in which he is worſhipped in that Temple, where his Mother was a Prieſteſs. Together with this, the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> gave him a noble Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, which <hi>Aurelian</hi> preſented again to the Emperor his Maſter: Theſe, to mention no more, were Omens of his future Grandeur.</p>

                     <p>He was handſome as to his Perſon, well<note place="margin">His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</note> made, tall, robuſt, with a good Grace, and a manly Mien; he eat and drank freely, rarely had to do with Women, extraordinary ſtrict, a great Maſter of Military Diſcipline, and very deſirous to be drawing the Sword. There were two <hi>Aurelians</hi> together in the Army, and both of them at the ſame time Tribunes. The other was taken Priſoner with the Emperor <hi>Valerian</hi> by the <hi>Perſians.</hi> The Army for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction gave this <hi>Aurelian</hi> the Nick-name of <hi>Hand to the Sword,</hi> becauſe he was ſo quick at it upon all occaſions, and he was known by this Name. He did ſeveral great Actions<note place="margin">His Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whilſt a private Man.</note> whilſt he was but in a private Quality. He alone defeated and repulſed the <hi>Sarmatae,</hi> in an Irruption which they made into the Province of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> when he had with him no more than three hundred Garriſon-Men. <hi>Theoclius,</hi> an Hiſtorian, ſays, that in the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> War, <hi>Aurelian</hi> with his own hand killed in one day eight and forty; and at ſeveral times in all, above nine hundred and fifty. Songs and Dances were made upon his Exploits, which were ſung upon the Feſtival Days in publick by the Youth, to this purpoſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Thouſand, a Thouſand, a Thouſand have we cut off; one Man hath killed a Thouſand, a Thouſand, a Thouſand; let him live a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, a Thouſand, a Thouſand Years, that hath killed a Thouſand, a Thouſand Enemies.</hi>

                     <p>Whilſt he was the Tribune of the ſixth Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which was at <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> he gave the <hi>Franks</hi> ſuch a blow, as they made their Excurſions up and down <hi>Gallia,</hi> that he killed ſeven Hundred of them, and took three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred others Priſoners, whom he ſold for Slaves.

                     <p>The Emperor complemented <hi>Crinitus</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and the Adoption of <hi>Aurelian</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Cuſtom ratified. What a certain <hi>Greek</hi> Author ſays, as I remember, that the Emperor commanded <hi>Crinitus</hi> to adopt <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> becauſe he was poor, I muſt leave to the Reader. I have ſaid, that the Emperor bore the Charge, of the Games, with which <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> entertain'd the People, at his entrance into his Conſulſhip; and I did it for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon eſpecially, to mark the Modeſty of the Expences of thoſe times, in compariſon with the Expences of others ſince. For we have lately ſeen the Games preſented in the Cirque by <hi>Furius Placidus</hi> upon his Conſulſhip, in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52508:360"/> which the Jockies and the Coachmen have had Eſtates rather given them, than their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Wages; Cloaths of Silk, fine Linens, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; at which ſober Men have been much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, becauſe it looks as if the Riches of a Man, more than his Virtue, had made him a Conſul. And perhaps many a one, who for his Virtue deſerves to be a Conſul, would be ruined by ſuch an Expence. But thoſe chaſt times are paſt, and by a popular Ambition which reigns amongſt us, we depart from them every day more and more. But this alſo I leave to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aurelian,</hi> raiſed by the Reputation of ſo many and ſo great Characters as theſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with ſo much luſtre in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> that after his Death and the Death of his Brother <hi>Quintillus,</hi> he ſucceeded upon the Throne of the Empire. There is a great-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement in this place in our Hiſtories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Death of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> with whom the Emperor <hi>Gallienus</hi> agreed to a Peace; as whether he was killed by <hi>Aureolan,</hi> without, or with the Order and Conſent of <hi>Claudius;</hi> and whether he was killed by <hi>Aurelian,</hi> after or before he came to the Empire? For in all theſe Queſtions the Hiſtorians, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the <hi>Greek,</hi> differ from one another. However it is, we are very ſure of this, that the Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> committed the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Scythians,</hi> to the Care of none more than <hi>Aurelian.</hi> I will give you here the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Claudius</hi> for that purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>Fathers of the Senate,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>IT is very Late, for us, at this day, to begin to conſult about the Safety of the State; It is very late for us, now to Conſult the Books of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> when we know not what elſe to do; like ſome ſick Perſons, who ſend not for the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, but in the greateſt extremity; to which yet it is never good to truſt; becauſe all Diſeaſes are the beſt taken and obviated in the beginning. You may remember, Gentlemen, that I have often from this place told you, even then, when firſt the news came of an Irruption of the <hi>Marcoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> that the Decrees of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52508:362"/> and that we ſhould ſerve our ſelves of the aſſiſtances of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and keep to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the immortal Gods. But my Motion was rejected, and that too not without a great deal of reproach from ſome, who in flattery to <hi>Aurelian</hi> anſwered, that under the Conduct of ſo brave a Prince, there was no neceſſity of conſulting the Gods; as if he did not himſelf revere the Gods, and hope for the ſucceſs of his Arms from their immortal Powers. In ſhort, you have heard his Letter, wherein he begs the Divine aſſiſtance, which it is never unworthy the greateſt Man to do: Therefore let the Prieſts, with all Purity, Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Sanctity, prepared as well in their Minds as Habits for ſo ſacred a Work, immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the Temple; and with due Reverence pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe the Holy Books, and examine what is the eternal will of the Fates; and we, on our parts, ſhall not be wanting to perform the Sacrifices, and obſerve the Solemnity, which the Gods require of us.</hi>

                     <p>The reſt of the Senators in ordor, being askt their Opinions, they all, ſome one way, ſome another declared their Conſent, that the Books of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> ſhould be conſulted, and<note place="margin">

                           <p>
                              <hi>I</hi> Admire, my good Fathers, that you have, ſo long heſitated about opening the Books of the <hi>Sibyls;</hi> as if it was a matter that was referred rather to a Congregation of Chriſtians, who are the Enemies of our Religion and our Gods, than to Perſons Zealous as you are for the Honour of the one and the other. I would deſire you to ſet the Prieſts immediately and religiouſly about it; that with the ſolemn Ceremonies and Rites, which ſhall there appear to be appointed, you may aſſiſt your Prince, now labouring under great difficulties. Let the Books be inſpected; and what things are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in required to be done, let them be done. For my part, I ſhall ſpare for no Coſts. The Captives that I have of any Nation, and any of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of the nobleſt kind, belonging to me, I freely offer for Sacrifices. It is no leſſening to a Victory, to be aſſiſted in it by the Gods. In the times of our Anceſtors, divers Wars have been begun and ended in this manner. I have writ to the Keeper of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to disburſe, whatever the Charge is. You may command thence what Money you think fit; and I am glad to find, that the Coffers are well provided.</p>

                     <p>That which was the occaſion of all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for inſpecting the Books of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> was; <hi>Aurelian</hi> had ſuffered a great defeat from the Enemy at <hi>Piacenza;</hi> and had it not been that after the examination of the ſaid Books,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52508:363"/> and the performance of the Sacrifices by them required, the Divine Aid interpoſed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and Affright the Barbarians with Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Spectres, and Prodigies, which gave <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> at length the advantage over them, the Victory in this War might have been loſt to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and even the Empire in danger to be ſo too. For the Barbarians, by the means of the Woods, and the Faſtneſſes, into which they threw themſelves, were otherwiſe too ſubtil for us, and did ſo annoy us upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that we ſhould not have reduced them, upon the ſingle ſtrength of our Arms.</p>
                     <p>After the <hi>Marcommanick</hi> War was ended, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> came to <hi>Rome;</hi> full of Anger and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, as he was naturally Fierce of himſelf, for the Seditions, which had there been raiſed in his abſence. Though he was otherwiſe a good Prince, he ſuffered his Paſſions to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport him beyond meaſure, and to puniſh ſome things Cruelly, which might have been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a gentler Hand. He not only put to<note place="margin">His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terme Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.</note> death the Authors of thoſe Seditions, but alſo ſome noble Senators; againſt whom appeared but one vile and wretched Witneſs; when the matter of the Crime objected, was of ſo ſlight a Nature, that a milder Prince would have contemned it. In fine, the fame of his Reign which had been hitherto great, and had juſtly gained him many Friends, was obſcured and wounded by the marks of his exceſſive Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He began to be feared, rather than loved. Some ſaid, they hated him; rather than wiſh'd his Proſperity; others ſaid that he
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52508:363"/> was indeed a good Phyſician, but his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines were the bittereſt in the World. After theſe things therefore, fearing again the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs might be revived, which happened in the time of <hi>Gallienus,</hi> he with the Advice of the Senate extended, and new fortified the Walls of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> He did not then extend the Territories of the City without the Walls; but he did afterwards; becauſe this was a priviledge allowed to no Prince to do, but who by his Conqueſts had added to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; as did the Emperors <hi>Auguſtus, Trajan, Nero;</hi> under which laſt particularly the <hi>Pontus, Potemoniacus,</hi> and the <hi>Cottian Alpes</hi> were ſubjected to the Obedience of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having finiſhed what concerned the ſecurity and ſtate of the City, and of the Civil Affairs, he ſet out from thence upon an Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Palmyreni</hi> in <hi>Syria;</hi> where the Lady <hi>Zenobia,</hi> in the Right of her two Sons, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennianus</hi> and <hi>Timolaus,</hi> being Infants, and in Succeſſion to <hi>Odenatus</hi> her Husband, Reigned as Queen of the Eaſt, and maintained the Revolt of thoſe parts againſt the Empire. In his way, in the Countries of <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Illyricum,</hi> he fought ſeveral conſiderable Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels with the Reliques of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and the Barbarians; of whom he ſlew five thouſand on the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> with <hi>Canna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baudes,</hi> their Prince. He paſſed, by the way of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> over into <hi>Bithynia,</hi> in the <hi>Leſſer Aſia:</hi> which Province upon his arrival voluntarily caſt off the Yoak of the <hi>Palmyreni,</hi>
                        <pb n="220" facs="tcp:52508:364"/> and yielded it ſelf to him. Many, as well of his Expreſſions as Actions, are great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. It is not poſſible, nor would I be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to recount them all here, becauſe it would be tedious. But yet ſome few may be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, which may ſerve to beget a better underſtanding of his Virtues and Manners. Coming to the City of <hi>Tyana</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which he found ſhut againſt him, he ſaid in a Paſſion, I will not leave a Dog in this place. This made his Soldiers ſtorm it the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, in hopes of the Booty; till one <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clammon,</hi> who was the Governour of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that he ſhould be killed amongſt the reſt, and thinking that he had no other way to ſave himſelf, betrayed his Truſt, and ſuffered the Town to be taken by Treachery. Now <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> did immediately two things, worthy of a Princely mind; in the one of which he ſhew'd an example of his Severity, and in the<note place="margin">Examples of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and Mercy.</note> other, of Mercy. The firſt is, he put to death <hi>Heraclammon</hi> for betraying his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Then, when the Soldiers deſired the total deſtruction of the Town, according to his ſaying, that he would not leave a Dog in it, by which they underſtood, that they ſhould have all the Plunder of it; <hi>It is true,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have ſaid I would not leave a Dog in this Town, and ſo kill all the Dogs:</hi> but he ſaved the People, and forbad the Plunder; which was a great Action, and it was followed by as great a one of the Army: becauſe they were as much pleaſed with the Wit of their Prince, as if he had given them really the Riches of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52508:364"/> City. Concerning <hi>Heraclammon, Aurelian</hi> writ this Letter.</p>

He is the only one of all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, who hath been ſo uſed. I cannot deny but he was Rich.

                     <p>The City of <hi>Tyana</hi> was taken in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Heraclammon</hi> betrayed to <hi>Aurelian</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate place, where there was a Natural riſing of the Ground, by which he might mount the Walls undiſcovered. <hi>Aurelian</hi> did ſo; and his Purple diſtinguiſhing him to be the Emperor to the Army without and the People within, and the People within ſeeing him upon the Walls, and concluding the Town was taken, as if the whole Army was with him, they were ſo ſurpriſed, that they ſaid no more but yielded.</p>
                     <p>I ought not here to omit a thing, which is to the Honour of the memory of the Vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Apollonius,</hi> who was a Native of the City of <hi>Tyana. Aurelian,</hi> it is ſaid, was ſeriouſly
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52508:365"/> ſometime thinking and ſpeaking about deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place entirely by Fire and Sword. But as he was going to his Tent, that wiſe Man of ſo known Fame and Authority, an Antient Philoſopher, and a true Friend of the Gods, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> who is himſelf to be highly<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anaeus.</note> Celebrated as a God, appeared ſuddenly to him, in the Form, in which his Image is in the Temples at this day, and ſpoke to him theſe words: <hi>Aurelian, Why ſhould you think of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my poor Countrymen? If you would Reign in Glory, abſtain,</hi> Aurelian, <hi>from the blood of the Innocent.</hi> Aurelian <hi>be merciful, if you would Conquer and live your ſelf. Aurelian</hi> knew the Viſage of the Venerable Philoſopher again, becauſe he had ſeen it before in ſeveral Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. He was very much ſtruck at it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he returned to a better mind about his Treatment of the Town, and promiſed to erect a Temple to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and to ſet up his Image and Statues. This account is what I have received from grave Men, and I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo often Read the ſame my ſelf in the Books of the <hi>Ulpian</hi> Library; to which I give the more Credit; becauſe I have a great reſpect for the Majeſty of <hi>Apollonius:</hi> than whom, what Man hath there ever been more Holy, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, Illuſtrious, and Divine? He raiſed the Dead to Life again. He wrought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things beyond the power of Mankind, and his Diſcourſes were ſuitable to his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which if any Perſon pleaſes to know more particularly, let him Read the <hi>Greek</hi> Books, that are written of his Life. My ſelf,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52508:365"/> if I live, and if the favour of <hi>Apollonius</hi> will aſſiſt me in it, will give the World ſome ſhort account at leaſt of the Actions of ſo great a Perſon: not that they want the benefit of my Labour, but that things which are really to be admired, may be made univerſally known and famous.</p>
                     <p>After the taking of <hi>Tyana, Aurelian</hi> marched towards <hi>Antioch;</hi> propoſing to all that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, Indemnity for what was paſt. At the Village of <hi>Daphne,</hi> which is near <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> he gave the Enemy a little Blow, and ſo came to that City. It is ſuppoſed, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Venerable <hi>Apollonius</hi> had made an impreſſion upon him; for he uſed his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory here with great Humanity and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The next Battel was a General one, and for no leſs than the Empire. It was fought at the City of <hi>Emiſſa</hi> in <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> againſt the Queen <hi>Zenobia,</hi> and <hi>Zabdas</hi> her General. <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Horſe were ſpent, and ready to run, when ſome Divine Form ſuddenly appearing to them, and encouraging them on to the Charge, they took the Example of the Foot, who all the while ſtood firm, till at laſt they put both <hi>Zenobia</hi> and <hi>Zabdas</hi> to flight, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<note place="margin">Zenobia'<hi>s Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</hi>
                        </note> a moſt accompliſht Victory. <hi>Emiſſa</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily yielded to the Conqueror; who no ſooner entred into it, but he repaired to the Temple of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> or the Sun, to acquit himſelf of his Vows and Devotions, according to his Duty. But as he was there, the ſame Divine Form appeared again to him which he had ſeen aſſiſting him in the Battel. Wherefore he there
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52508:366"/> founded Temples, and made great Oblations. He Founded alſo a Temple to the Sun at <hi>Rome,</hi> of extraordinary Magnificence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhall have an occaſion to ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>Then he bent his Courſe againſt the City of <hi>Palmyra,</hi> the Capitol of the Country of the People of the ſame name, where <hi>Zenobia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided; that with the taking of it, he might put an end to his Labours in this part of the World. The <hi>Syrian</hi> Robbers annoyed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my often in his March, and did him much miſchief. But in the Siege of <hi>Palmyra,</hi> his Perſon was ſo far in danger, that he received a ſlight Shot of an Arrow. And the hot Work that he met with, is very plainly confeſſed by himſelf, in a Letter to <hi>Mucapor,</hi> thus.</p>

                     <p>Securer now therefore of the State of the Eaſt, than ever, he returned the ſecond time back to <hi>Europe;</hi> and with his accuſtomed Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very he defeated all the Parties of his <hi>European</hi> Enemies, that came in his way.

                        <hi>Gallia</hi> continued as yet in its Revolt from the Empire, and in the Hands of <hi>Tetricus:</hi> which <hi>Aurelian,</hi> as he was naturally Fierce, and full of Deſigns, not being able with Patience to bear, he turned his Head to the ſide of the Weſt: where <hi>Tetricus</hi> weary of Commanding<note place="margin">Tetricus <hi>yields.</hi>

                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:52508:369"/>
                     <p>The Peace of the Weſt did conclude <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> the entire Maſter of all the <hi>Roman</hi> World. Every part of it now was reduced to him; and ſo he took his way to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> to Celebrate a Solemn Triumph, at once over <hi>Zenobia</hi> and <hi>Tetricus,</hi> that is, the Eaſt and the Weſt.</p>
                     <p>It will not be amiſs to know the manner of the Triumph of <hi>Aurelian;</hi> for it was a very Noble one. There were three Chariots of<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Manner of</hi> Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</hi>
                        </note> State, worthy of the Magnificence of the greateſt Kings. The firſt was the Chariot of <hi>Odenatus,</hi> curiouſly wrought and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Silver, Gold, and Jewels. The next was a Chariot of the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> which was equally Fine. The third was <hi>Zenobia</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, which ſhe had made for herſelf, in hopes to make her Entrance into the City of <hi>Rome</hi> with: nor was ſhe miſtaken. For ſhe did ſo; but it was in the Quality of a Captive, and both her Chariot and ſhe were led in Triumph. There was a fourth Chariot drawn by four Stags, ſuppoſed to be the Chariot of the King of the <hi>Goths.</hi> In this Chariot, <hi>Aurelian</hi> Rode to the Capitol, to Sacrifice there thoſe Stags, which together with the Chariot, when he took them, he had vowed to the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and moſt mighty <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Theſe Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots were preceded by twenty Elephants, and two hundred tamed Wild Beaſts of ſeveral kinds, out of the Countries of <hi>Libya</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine;</hi> all which <hi>Aurelian</hi> gave afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way amongſt particular Perſons. There were four Tygers. The Chamoiſes, Elks, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52508:370"/> ſuch Beaſts followed in order. There were eight hundred couple of Gladiators. Then followed the Captives of the Barbarian Nations; as <hi>Ethiopians, Arabians, Indians, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrians, Georgians, Saracens, Perſians;</hi> every one with their ſeveral Offerings: there were alſo <hi>Goths, Alans, Roxolans, Sarmatians, Franks Sueves, Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Germans;</hi> all which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives were chained by the Hand to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: together with whom were the chief, that were left alive, of the City of <hi>Palmyra;</hi> and alſo a parcel of <hi>Egyptians,</hi> becauſe of the late Rebellion in <hi>Egypt.</hi> There were ten Women Captives, led in the like manner, in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: they were taken fighting in Men's Habit amongſt the <hi>Goths;</hi> when many others of them, at the ſame time were killed. The Inſcription over them, as all theſe Nations had their ſeveral Names and Inſcriptions put up, ſpoke them to be of the Race of the <hi>Amazons.</hi> Then came <hi>Tetricus,</hi> well dreſſed in a Scarlet Robe, and a ſort of a Pale-gold-coloured Tunick, and his Breeches of the Mode of the <hi>Gauls.</hi> By him marched his Son, whom he had declared Joynt-Emperor with him in <hi>Gallia.</hi> And next marched <hi>Zenobia.</hi> She was adorned with Jewels, and her Chains were of Gold, with Perſons to bear them up. The Crowns of the Vanquiſhed Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Gold, were diſplayed and carried in the Proceſſion. Then marched the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all the Standards of the Colleges and the Camps, the Cuiraſſiers, the Train of the Court, all the Army, and likewiſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52508:370"/> but the Senate was a little concerned to ſee one of their own Body, which <hi>Tetricus</hi> was, led in Triumph. However it is, all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether added much to the magnificence of the Pomp. It was almoſt three of the Clock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Proceſſion to the Capitol was over; and late before they went from thence to the Court. The next, and the other days follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were ſpent in the pleaſures of the Plays of the Stage, the Races of the Cirque, the Chaſes of Wild Beaſts, the Fights of the Gladiators, and the Encounters or Fights of Gallies, in the Amphitheatre, repreſented ſailing there as upon a Sea.</p>
                     <p>It is not, I think, to be omitted, what our Hiſtories do often take notice of, and every one remembers, that when <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſet out upon the Oriental War againſt <hi>Zenobia,</hi> he promiſed to give the People, if he returned a Conqueror, Crowns of two pound weight. The People willingly underſtood him of Crowns of Gold. But <hi>Aurelian</hi> neither could, nor would be ſo liberal. He gave them every one Loaves of the whiteſt Bread of that weight, made in the form of Crowns; which he continued all his life, to them and their Children daily. He diſtributed alſo Portions of Pork amongſt them, and this is done to this day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aurelian</hi> made ſeveral Laws, which were all Good and Wholeſome. He augmented the Revenues of the Prieſts: he founded a Temple to the Sun; and ſet out Salaries for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Prieſts that ſhould ſerve it and for the Repairs of it, and for its other inferior Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>

                     <p>After theſe things he went into <hi>Gallia,</hi> and raiſed the Siege of the City of <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> which the Barbarians had formed. From thence he returned, and came into <hi>Illyricum;</hi> where having provided himſelf with rather a Valiant, than a Numerous Army, he declared War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Perſians;</hi> over whom he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a very notable Victory, at the ſame time that he overcame <hi>Zenobia,</hi> who was their Ally. But as he was upon his march to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Enterpriſe, at a Caſtle called <hi>Caen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Death of</hi> Aurelian.</note> of <hi>Mucapour,</hi> he was killed.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion of his Murder, and in what manner it was brought about, that a matter of that Moment may not be concealed, I will tell you in ſhort. It cannot be denyed, but that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was a Severe, Truculent, and a Sanguinary Prince. His Severity had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported him ſo far, as to kill his own Siſters Daughter, for no great nor ſufficient cauſe neither; which was the firſt thing that brought an odium upon him amongſt his Friends. As Fate would have it, it happened, that he had one <hi>Mneſtheus,</hi> to be his Secretary; who, ſome<note place="margin">The Plot upon him how laid.</note> ſay, was his late Slave, made Free. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> upon I know not what ſuſpicion of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, had threatned this Man, which made him his Mortal Enemy. For knowing that his Maſter neither uſed to threaten to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor to forgive very eaſily, where he once threatned, he writ down a Liſt of the Names
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52508:371"/> of ſuch Perſons, as he knew <hi>Aurelian</hi> had a real diſtate againſt; and at the ſame time he intermixt it with the Names of others, of whom <hi>Aurelian</hi> never had the leaſt ſuſpicion, which ſhould make him hate them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, he added his own, to give the greater Credit to his concern for the common ſafety, in which himſelf was involved. When he had done this, he went and read the Liſt to all thoſe, whoſe names were there, and told them, that it was what he had privately found upon <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and it ſhews, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was reſolved to kill them all, and therefore, if they were Men, they ought to look to their Lives. The one party, who knew themſelves to have contracted <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s anger by what they had done, were ſpurred on by their fears to believe the matter and to prevent <hi>Aurelian</hi> if they could. The other, who had ever been kind and ſerviceable to him, and had deſerved no ſuch uſage from him, were incenſed at his ſuppoſed Ingratitude. So mingling their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Sorrows together, the one with the other, they fell upon him ſuddenly at the place before-mentioned upon the Road, and killed him.</p>
                     <p>This was the end of the Emperor <hi>Aurelian.</hi> A Prince, not properly ſo good, as his Reign was of uſe, and neceſſary to retrieve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Empire. When the matter after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came to be diſcovered, how fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Conſpiracy was procured to kill him, the Perſons themſelves that had agreed to it, built him a great Sepulchre, and Dedicated a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52508:372"/> Temple to him, and ſet up his Statues, at the place of his Death: And <hi>Mneſtheus</hi> was tied to a ſtake, and given to be devoured by Wild Beaſts; which is ſignified upon the place by Marble Statues of <hi>Mneſtheus,</hi> done in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in which he was executed, and ſet up on each ſide of the Sepulchre of <hi>Aurelian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Senate regretted his Death very much, and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> more; who commonly ſaid, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was the Tutor of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. He reigned ſix Years, wanting a few Days; and for his great Actions was dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                     <p>Not to omit any thing, that I meet within Hiſtory that relates to him; many ſay, that <hi>Quintillus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Claudius,</hi> who when<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Death of</hi> Quintil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> the News came to him of the Death of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> was in a Garriſon in <hi>Italy,</hi> aſſumed the Empire, upon that News, to ſucceed his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But when afterwards he found, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was choſen Emperor by all the Army, and that when he harangued againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of <hi>Aurelian</hi> to his own Soldiers, they did not much care to hear him, he cut his Veins himſelf, and died the Twentieth day of his Reign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aurelian</hi> did this Service to the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; that he purged away all profeſſed Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Irreligion and wicked Arts.

                        <hi>Aurelian</hi> reduced them with a high hand; it coſt him the Lives of ſeven Thouſand of his Soldiers to do it; upon which occaſion he writ this Letter to his Father (by Adoption) <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius Crinitus,</hi> who was then the third time Conſul.</p>

                     <p>Fathers of the Senate,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>WELL had the immortal Gods conſulted the Happineſs of the World, had they made the Perſons of good Men invulnerable; that ſuch as meditate baſe Murder in their wicked Hearts, could have had no Power to hurt them. Then had we enjoyed our Emperor <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> longer, who was one of the greateſt uſe to our State; which after the misfortunes of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerina,</hi> and the Luxury of <hi>Gallienus,</hi> began to take breath again indeed under the Reign of <hi>Claudius;</hi> but it had been perfectly reſtored to its priſtine form by <hi>Aurelian,</hi> had he lived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Victory every where waited upon his Arms. He re-poſſeſſed us of <hi>Gallia;</hi> he delivered <hi>Italy</hi> from the Invaſion of the <hi>Marcomanni;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued <hi>Ausburgh</hi> from the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Yoke; he recovered <hi>Illyricum</hi> and <hi>Thrace</hi> to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Romans;</hi> he recovered the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52508:374"/> our obedience, which was ſhamefully before oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and held againſt us by a Woman. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> while yet inſulting in the Death of <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> he vanquiſhed, put them to flight, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved them. The <hi>Saracens,</hi> the <hi>Blemmies,</hi> and <hi>Auxumitae,</hi> the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> the <hi>Seres,</hi> the <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> the <hi>Albanians,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and even the <hi>Indians</hi> adored him almoſt as a God upon Earth. The Capitol is enrich'd with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and the things which he gained from the Barbarian Nations. Fifteen Thouſand Pound weight of Gold, of his Liberality, lies all in one Temple. All the Fanes in <hi>Rome</hi> ſhine by his Gifts. Wherefore, Gentlemen, may I not juſtly expoſtulate with the Gods, why they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Maſſacre of ſuch a Prince; unleſs it is perhaps, that they would rather have him in their own Number? I for my part vote him a God, and I preſume, that all you will do the ſame. But as for the Election of another Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, it is a Matter in my Opinion, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred back to the Army again. For unleſs it were certain that the Perſon elected by us will be by them accepted, it will both be dangerous to the elected, and bring an envy upon his Friends.</hi>

                     <p>What ſhall I ſay now to obſerve, that out of ſo many Perſons, that have ſat upon the Throne of <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> down to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> there hath hitherto been ſo few, that have been good Princes?

On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, what a Series have we had of ill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces! For not to mention the <hi>Vitellii,</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula's,</hi> and the <hi>Nero's</hi> of former Ages, What do you ſay to the <hi>Maximins,</hi> the <hi>Philips,</hi> and that unſavory multitude, that droſs, that came up afterwards? excepting only the <hi>Decii,</hi> whoſe Lives and Manners were comparable with thoſe of the Antients.</p>
                     <p>It may be asked, what it is that debauches Princes, and makes them become ſo ill? And truly, my dear Friend, I will tell you. Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, in the firſt place; then the Plenty
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52508:375"/> that ſurrounds them; then evil Counſellors, evil Guards, greedy Eunuchs, lewd or fooliſh Courtiers; nor can this laſt be denied, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Affairs of the Publick. I aſſure you, I have heard it from my Father, that the Emperor <hi>Diocleſian</hi> hath ſaid, when he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved privately at <hi>Salona,</hi> after his reſignation of the Empire, <hi>That there is nothing more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult than to Reign well.</hi> For four or five Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall cabal together, to put upon the Prince, and tell him what is to be done; in the mean time, he who is ſhut up at home, penetrates not into the Truth, and is forced to know no more than they tell him; and ſo he makes Perſons Magiſtrates and Officers, whom he ought to avoid, and turns others out, whom he ought to keep. In fine, as <hi>Diocleſian</hi> ſaid, for theſe are alſo his words, <hi>The Good, the Cautious, the Beſt Prince that is, is bought and ſold.</hi> Which I therefore remark, that you may pleaſe, Sir, to obſerve, that there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not any thing more difficult than the Art of Reigning well.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aurelian</hi> is many times accounted neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ill, nor yet amongſt the good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe Clemency, which is the firſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Prince was wanting to him. His exceſſive Fierceneſs was a thing which dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd his Character with the Emperor <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian;</hi> who, as he blamed the aſperity of <hi>Maximinian,</hi> ſo he often ſaid of <hi>Aurelian</hi> in the hearing of <hi>Verconius Herennianus,</hi> who was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guards to him, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> ought rather to have been continued a General, than
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52508:376"/> to have been made a Prince. He ſaid alſo, according to <hi>Aſclepiodotus,</hi> that <hi>Aurelian</hi> once conſulted with the <hi>Druids</hi> of <hi>Gallia,</hi> whether the Empire was to deſcend after him upon his Poſterity. Their Anſwer was, that the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Claudius</hi> ſhould carry the greateſt Name of any in the Empire. And certainly the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Conſtantius</hi> is one of the Blood of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> whoſe Line will one day attain, I doubt not, to that Glory, which was fore-told by the <hi>Druids.</hi> But I only mention this in the Life of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> becauſe the Conſultation and the Anſwer was made by, and to him. It may ſeem perhaps wonderful; as it is, I leave it to the Judgment of Poſterity.</p>

He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Gentlewomen to wear fine Purples, whereas before they went in flowered and mixt coloured Silks, or at the moſt, ſomething that was only a little near to Purple. He was the firſt that ſuffered the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmon Soldiers to have their Buttons gilt. He was the firſt that gave them Linens. For before they had only Ruſſet Coats, which were adorned with ſome one, or two, or three, or ſome five Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings.

Not occaſioned by any Breach betwixt the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Army; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Senate deferred the Election of the new Emperor to the Army, and the Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it again to the Senate, and the diſpute betwixt them was grateful and very handſome. There was, as our Eldeſt Annals inform us, formerly an <hi>Interregnum</hi> after the death of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> in the Infant-State of the Empire of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52508:379"/> 
                        <hi>Rome.</hi> But the differences betwixt that <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum</hi> and this, are many. For in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, till ſuch time as a fit Perſon was pitch'd upon to ſucceed the good <hi>Romulus,</hi> an <hi>Interrex</hi> was expreſly from time to time appointed to Govern out of the Senate: which then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of one hundred Members, each Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whoſe Health did not diſable him, took it in his courſe to be the <hi>Interrex</hi> for three or four, or five days: So the whole Year and more, that the <hi>Interregnum</hi> laſted, paſſed under the Government of the Senators; who reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one after another, all of them, from the firſt to the laſt, without diſtinction, becauſe as they were all of equal Dignity, ſo they ſhould all have an equal Taſte of the Empire. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe during the Government of the Conſuls and the Tribunes of the Soldiers, which laſt had the Authority, but only not the Name of Conſuls, whenever it happened that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was vacant, an <hi>Interrex</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Act, till ſuch time as the Government was filled again. And though it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to this, That once, at that time, for the ſpace of four Years, we had no Perſons in the Chairs of the Conſuls, nor any Magiſtrates preſiding in the Nature of them; yet I anſwer, that there were then Tribunes of the People, endowed with ſuch a Power, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors who have enjoy'd the ſame Power ſince, have thought it one of the brighteſt Jewels in their Crown. Nor is it any where averred, that then there was no <hi>Interrex</hi> neither who acted beſides theſe Tribunes. Becauſe our moſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52508:380"/> Authentick Hiſtories ſay, that when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Conſuls were re-continued, it was the <hi>Interrex,</hi> who by his Authority ſummoned the Aſſemblies of the People to do it; and therefore there was an <hi>Interrex</hi> then in the State. So that in this reſpect the State of <hi>Rome</hi> was never ſo vacant, as it was after the death of <hi>Aurelian:</hi> For here there was a perfect <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum</hi> without any <hi>Interrex</hi> for ſix Months; whereas before the State was never without an <hi>Interrex,</hi> ſo much as for two or three days.</p>
                     <p>This was a rare and a difficult Conjuncture. It was no leſs remarkable, if we obſerve the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Concord of the Army, the profound Peace of the People, and the venerable Authority of the Senate in all that time. No Uſurper ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any where up. The whole World wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Every one kept to his Devoir, and which is one of the beſt Principles in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of humane Life, in reverence to himſelf. The Temperament of Men was admirable, and made the Delay it ſelf happy and worthy to be for ever remembred; That thoſe who ſeek after Crowns, may learn, that Empires ought not to be raviſhed, but to be deſerved.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion and manner of the Delay that was made, was thus. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> as the laſt written Life ſhews, was killed by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a wicked Secretary, who, as Fictions and Falſities go a great way with Soldiers, if they are told them either in their anger, or
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52508:380"/> many times in their drink (though it is always next to a madneſs to believe them) drew in a Party of the Great Men of the Army, by an Incredulity on their ſides, into a Plot with him, to kill him. But all theſe Perſons being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to a better Sentiment, and ſeverely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuted of their Error by the Army, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be conſider'd, whom next to make Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. The Army, who had uſed to ſet up an Emperor in a trice, hated thoſe who had had a hand in the Murder of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and who at the ſame time were of the Top of their Body. So they ſent to the Senate the Letter which you have in the Life preceding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they deſired that the Senate would, out of their Houſe, make choice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> that the Princes choſen by them, do not always pleaſe the Army, and they remitted the Choice to the Army again. This was repeated ſo often in reciprocal Complements from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it was ſix Months before the Senate came to the Election of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> which was in the manner as follows.</p>
                     <p>Upon the 7th. day of the Calends of <hi>October,</hi> the Senate being met in the <hi>Curia Pompiliana, Velius Cornificius Gordianus</hi> the Conſul, ſpoke thus to them:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fathers of the Senate, What we have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to you already, we muſt now do it again, to chooſe an Emperor; without whom, the Army cannot well ſubſiſt longer, and there is a Neceſſity which obliges us to it beſides. For the <hi>Germans</hi>
                           <pb n="254" facs="tcp:52508:381"/> have broken into the Quarter on the ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and have poſſeſſed themſelves there of Strong, Noble, Rich, and Powerful Cities. And though there is nothing mentioned of any Motions of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> yet you may eaſily imagine, how light the Minds of the <hi>Syrians</hi> are, when rather than ſuffer our Government, which is ſo Juſt, they have deſired Women to Reign over them. What ſhall I ſay to you of <hi>Africa,</hi> of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the Armies in all thoſe Parts? How long do you think can they ſubſiſt without an Emperor? Wherefore, Gentlemen, go now about it, and Name one: Either the Army will Accept him whom you ſhall chooſe, or themſelves will chooſe ſome other, if they refuſe him.</hi>

                        <hi>We Salute <hi>Tacitus,</hi> our Emperor. The Gods ſave you. We Chooſe you. We make you our Prince; We commit the Care of the State and of the World to you. Take the Empire, given you by the Authority of the Senate. Your Place, your Life, your good Intentions deſerve it. The Prince of the Senate is very juſtly to be created the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign. The Senator of the Firſt Voice is deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly preferred to be Emperor. And who is better to Reign, than a Perſon of Gravity as you are? Who is better to Govern, than one that is ſo knowing as you? We think it is an Happineſs and an Excellency in you to be Congratulated, That you have been long a Private Perſon. You,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52508:381"/> who have gone through the Reigns of other Princes, know how to Reign your ſelf. You know very well how to Command, who have obſerved and judged of the Government of others before you.</hi>

                        <hi>Tacitus</hi> Anſwered:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am aſtoniſhed, Fathers of the Senate, That in the Place of the moſt Valiant <hi>Aurelian,</hi> you are willing to make ſuch an Old Man Emperor. How am I fit, with theſe Limbs which you behold, to manage the Dart and the Spear, and to rattle it in Armour, and to be often riding in exact Form for an Example to the Soldiers. Scarce can I fulfil the Duties of the Senate; I am hardly able to do that, to which my particular Place confines me. Conſider then more carefully, what an advanced Age you take out of the Chamber and the Shade, to ſend it into Froſts and Heats? Can you believe, that the Army will approve of an Old Man to be at the Head of them? Think upon ſome other, who will better anſwer the Expectations which you have of him, and let me be contented in a Private Life with this, That you have unanimouſly Loved me.</hi>

                     <p>Then they went to take the Suffrages of each Senator in particular. The next to <hi>Tacitus</hi> was <hi>Moecius Falconius Nicomachus,</hi> who was of the degree of a Conſul. He being ask'd his Opinion, diſcourſed the Senate in theſe words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fathers of the Senate, This moſt Noble Houſe hath ever rightly and prudently conſulted the Good of the State: Nor is there any Nation upon the Earth, from whom one ought to expect a greater ſhare of ſolid Wiſdom, than from you. But yet I muſt ſay, That of, all the Inſtances of your Wiſdom, there never was a Determination paſs'd by you, more Grave and more Judicious, than what hath
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52508:382"/> been done in this preſent Aſſembly. We have choſen a Perſon of an advanced Age to be our Prince, and one who may conſult the Good of us all as a Father. Nothing from him that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature, that is unadviſed, that is ill, is to be feared. We may promiſe our ſelves a Reign of all Sobriety, all Gravity, and as the State would in a manner have it. For he knows, what a Prince he hath always wiſhed to himſelf to have; and he cannot give us a different one in his own Perſon, from what he hath deſired to find in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Certainly if we will reflect upon thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of ill Princes of the Antient Times, I mean the <hi>Nero</hi>'s, the <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>'s, and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi>'s, it will appear, that their Crimes were not more the Vices of the Men, than the Vices of their Age. The Gods defend us from having Boys to be our Sovereigns, and Children to be called the Fathers of our Country; who muſt have Maſters to hold their Hands when they Sign their Orders, and will be invited to make Perſons Conſuls, by the Sugar-plumbs and the Cakes, and every Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Pleaſure that is given them. What Reaſon, I pray, is there to have an Emperor, who does not know how to take the care of his Reputation? who does not underſtand what a State is; that fears his Educator, is Commanded by his Nurſe, and lies under the Magiſterial Laſh and Terror of the Hands of his Maſter? What Conſuls, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, what Magiſtrates is he like to give us, when as to the Lives, Merits, Ages, Families and Actions of the Perſons whom he prefers, truly be underſtands nothing at all of them? But why am I here drawn to beſtow, Gentlemen, ſo many
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52508:383"/> words upon this ſubject? Let us rather Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the choice, which we have made of a Prince, who is a Man of Years, than to iterate thoſe things that have been beyond meaſure deplorable to the Perſons that have ſuffered under them. I give there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my repeated Thanks to the Immortal Gods for this Choice. I offer the ſame likewiſe in the Name of the whole State. And to you, <hi>Tacitus,</hi> our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, I turn my ſelf to beg of you, to beſeech you, to intreat you, generouſly in the behalf of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Country, that if it ſhall be the Will of the Fates that you die whilſt your own Sons are yet but young, you would not make thoſe Children Heirs, after you, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; nor in ſuch a nature leave this State, this Senate, and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if the firſt was no more than your <hi>Villa,</hi> and we all your Tenants and your Slaves. Conſider very well, and imitate the Examples of <hi>Nerva, Trajan,</hi> and <hi>Hadrian.</hi> It is a great honour in a dying Prince, to love his Country more than his Iſſue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tacitus</hi> was extreamly moved, and the whole Senate ſtruck with this Speech; and preſently they cryed, <hi>We All, All, ſay the ſame;</hi> and ſo the Houſe roſe. They went from thence unto the <hi>Field of Mars:</hi> where <hi>Tacitus</hi> having placed himſelf upon the Tribunal, <hi>Aelius Ceſetianus</hi> the Governour of the City, ſpoke thus to a General Aſſembly, there met, of all the People:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gentlemen-Soldiers, and you the good Citizens and Commons of</hi> Rome; <hi>You have here the Prince, whom by the conſent of all the</hi> Roman <hi>Armies,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52508:383"/> the Senate hath made choice of to fill the Throne. The moſt Noble</hi> Tacitus, <hi>I ſay; who, as he hath hitherto aſſiſted by his Suffrages to the good of the Senate, ſo he is now choſen to do the ſame by his Command and Conſultations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The People cryed, <hi>All Happineſs to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> Tacitus. <hi>The Gods ſave your Majeſty,</hi> and the like, as uſual.</p>
                     <p>It is not here to be omitted, what ſeveral have writ, That <hi>Tacitus</hi> was in his abſence, and whilſt he was in the <hi>Campagna,</hi> nam'd to be Emperor; which I cannot deny to be in ſome<note place="margin">His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Empire.</note> meaſure true. For as ſoon as the Rumour had broken out, that he was the Perſon intended to be Elected, he retired from the Town, and went and kept himſelf two Months at <hi>Bajae.</hi> But they fetched him from thence again, and he was preſent at this Act of the Senate, as altogether a private Perſon, and really did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his Elevation. For that no body may think, that I have raſhly given Credit to the Teſtimony of any either Greek or Latin Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as to this Matter, there is in the <hi>Ulpian</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary in the Sixth Apartment, a Book in Tables of Ivory, in which this Act of the Senate is regiſtred at large, ſubſcribed by <hi>Tacitus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own hand. It was a long time; a Cuſtom to Regiſter ſuch Acts, as concerned the Crown, upon Tables of Ivory.</p>
                     <p>From the Aſſembly of the People, <hi>Tacitus</hi> next went to the Camp of the Guards; where having taken his Place upon a High Tribunal, <hi>Maeſius Gallicanus</hi> the Captain of the Guards, directed himſelf to the Soldiers in theſe words:</p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:52508:384"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My very good Fellow-Soldiers, The Senate hath given you the Prince whom you deſired. That moſt Noble Houſe hath readily comply'd with the Will of the Camp. It is not for me to ſay more to you, in the preſence of the Emperor himſelf. Therefore hear him, who is our Maſter, attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whilſt he ſpeaks to you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpoke thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When <hi>Trajan</hi> came to the Empire, it is true, he was pretty well in Years, and he was appointed by only one Perſon neither. But as for my ſelf, in the firſt place, you my excellent Fellow Soldiers, who know what Princes you do approve of, and in the next, the moſt Honourable the Senate hath adjudged me to this Place. It ſhall be my care, I will make it my endeavour and my buſineſs, to furniſh you, if not with great Atchievements, yet at leaſt with Counſels worthy of you and your Emperor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He promiſed them a Bounty and their Pay, according to Cuſtom; and the firſt Harangue which he made afterwards to the Senate, was this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fathers of the Senate, So let me ever in ſuch a manner Govern the Empire, as that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to owe my Election to you, by whoſe Advice and Authority I have reſolved to do all things. You will therefore pleaſe to Command and to Enjoyn me, what you think to be for the Common good of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52508:384"/> your ſelves, the Army, and the People of</hi> Rome. He proceeded in the ſame Speech to tell them, That he reſolved to ſet up a Statue of <hi>Aurelian</hi> in Gold in the Capitol, with others of Silver, in the Houſe of the Senate, in the Temple of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and in the <hi>Forum</hi> of <hi>Trajan.</hi> Theſe latter were accordingly Dedicated; but that of Gold was not. In the ſame Speech he provided, That if any Perſon publickly or privately adulterated Silver with Braſs, or Gold with Silver, or Braſs with Lead, it ſhould be Capital, and loſs of Eſtate. Alſo, that Slaves ſhould not be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt the Lives of their Maſters; no, not in Caſes of Treaſon. He obliged all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to have Pictures of <hi>Aurelian.</hi> He order'd a Temple to be built, where they ſhould ſet up the Statues of ſuch of the Deified Emperors as Reigned well; and offer Sacrifices to them, upon their ſeveral Anniverſaries, the Birth-day of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Calends of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary.</hi> In the ſame Speech, he deſired the Conſuſhip for his Brother <hi>Florianus;</hi> but the Senate could not grant it; becauſe all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, Ordinary and Extraordinary, that is, the Conſuls for the whole Year and the Conſuls for every two Months had been already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Senate. <hi>Tacitus</hi> was much pleaſed with the liberty which the Senate took to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Brother the Conſulſhip, though himſelf had asked it; and ſaid, <hi>The Senate knows whom they have made their Prince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He turn'd his Eſtate, which was worth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Millions of Crowns, over into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer; and the ready Money that he had
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52508:385"/> by him, he applied to the Pay of the Soldiers. He wore the ſame Cloaths as he did when he<note place="margin">His pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Acts and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> was a Private Man. He put down the Publick Bawdy-houſes within the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> but this could not hold long. He order'd all the Baths to be ſhut up before Candle-light, for fear of Diſturbances being committed in them in the Night. He acknowledg'd <hi>Corn. Tacitus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorian, as his Relation, and commanded his Book to be ſet up in all the Libraries; and for the more careful preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to Poſterity, he order'd it every Year to be Copied over Ten times, and the Copies to be repoſed in the Libraries and in the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the Ingenious. He forbad all Men the wearing of Velvet. He pulled down his late Dwelling-Houſe, and order'd a Publick Bath to be built in its place, at his proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. He gave a hundred Columns of the <hi>Numidian</hi> Marble, of three and twenty foot each, to the City of <hi>Oſtia.</hi> The Poſſeſſion which he had in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> he Aſſigned to the Repairs of the Capitol. His Table Plate of Silver, which he had uſed in his private Life, he dedicated to the ſervices of the Feaſts, made in the Temples. He granted an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſement to all his Slaves that he had at <hi>Rome,</hi> of both Sexes, under the Number of a Hundred; but no more, becauſe he would not exceed the ſtint of the <hi>Caninian</hi> Law. He lived a very ſober Life; never in a whole day<note place="margin">His mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diet.</note> drank a Quart of Wine, and many times not a Pint. One Pullet, a Swine's Cheek, and Eggs, ſufficed for his Dinner, with an abundance of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52508:385"/> Herbs, and eſpecially Lettuces, in which he paſſionately indulged himſelf; becauſe he ſaid, that that was a profuſeneſs which purchaſed him Sleep. He loved the bitterer Herbs; ſeldom Bathed, which I believe made him the ſtronger in his Old Age: Delighted extraordinarily in the curious-wrought Glaſſes, and the ſeveral ſorts thereof, that are made in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> His Breakfaſt was never any thing, but a piece of dry Bread ſeaſoned with Salt, and the like. He was a great Maſter in Architecture. He loved fine Marble, and ſtately Buildings, and Hunting. In fine, his Table was Coarſe, and preſented you with no Rarities: Not with a Pheaſant, unleſs it was upon the Birth-day of himſelf or ſome of his Relations, and upon extraordinary Holidays. The Sacrifices, which he had offered in the Temples, he always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demanded home, and order'd them to be eaten by his Family. He ſuffered his Wife to wear no Jewels: He forbad all the wearing of any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery in Gold: For it was he, who had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed <hi>Aurelian</hi> to forbid the ſame, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the Gilding of Rooms, and the Gilding of Leather. It would be tedious to particularize in every thing concerning him, eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Suetonius Optatianus,</hi> who hath written his Life at large. If any Perſon be ſo curious to know more, I refer him thither. As Old as he was, he read the leaſt-written Hand to a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and he never intermitted a Night, but he either read or writ ſomething, excepting the day after the Kalends of a Month, which he look'd upon as Unfortunate.</p>

                     <p>The great Joy of the Senate, to be re-poſſeſſed again of the Right of the Choice of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, was ſuch as I cannot forbear to mention, nor is it ſcarce ever to be forgotten. They order'd Publick Proceſſions to be made upon it, and every one promiſed to offer a Hecatomb: They writ of it to their Friends, and not only to their Friends, but to Strangers abroad; and into the Provinces, for all their Allies and all Nations to know, that <hi>Rome</hi> had now recovered its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient State, and now the Senate choſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and Reigned in a manner with him; and made the Laws; and the Kings of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> were to ſupplicate to the Senate, and War and Peace was to be Treated by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Senate. Some of theſe ſort of Letters, for the greater ſatisfaction, I will give you here, as follows:</p>

                     <p>It would be too long to adjoyn all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this kind, which I have ſeen and read. I only ſay this, that all the Senators were ſo elated with Joy for the return of their Antient Power, that in their Houſes they all ſlew their Sacrifices, and expoſed their Images, and cloathed themſelves in White, and Feaſted, as
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52508:387"/> if they thought, that the days of their happy Forefathers were revived upon them.</p>
                     <p>All the Murderers of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> as well the better, as the worſe, after <hi>Tacitus</hi> was ſettled in the Empire, he made it his buſineſs to put to death; notwithſtanding the baſeneſs of that Murder had been already revenged in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of <hi>Mneſtheus,</hi> the chief contriver of it. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> on the ſide of the Lake <hi>Maeotis,</hi> in great numbers made an Eruption. But <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> partly by force, and other means, obliged them to retire.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the chief Glory of the Reign of <hi>Tacitus</hi> was in the manner of his Elevation. For the time that he lived afterwards being ſo ſhort, what liberty had he for any thing that is Great? So that what <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, <hi>That it is more for our Honour, to have it told, how a Man hath managed a Conſulſhip, than how he came by it,</hi> it takes no place here. <hi>Tacitus</hi> dyed in the ſixth Month of his Reign, ſome ſay of a Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſome, that he was killed by the Soldiers. It is certain, that he was oppreſſed with Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this work'd much upon his Mind and Spirits.</p>
                     <p>He was both Born, and made Emperor in the Month of <hi>September:</hi> For which reaſon, he had a fancy to change the Name of that Month to his own. His Brother <hi>Florianus</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him.</p>
                     <p>He ſcarce gave the People of <hi>Rome</hi> a Largeſs in all his ſix Months. His Picture is drawn in five ſeveral Dreſſes, upon a Table in the Houſe of the <hi>Quintilii;</hi> in a Gown, in a Veſt, in Armour,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52508:388"/> in a Cloak, and in a Hunting Habit. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his Reign were theſe. In the Temple of <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> one in a Fit of Frenzy, in which the Prieſts delivered their Oracles, ſtretching out his Arms, cryed with all his force, <hi>The Purple of</hi> Tacitus! <hi>The Purple of</hi> Tacitus! ſeven<note place="margin">Omens of his Reign and Death</note> times. A Vine, which uſed to bring forth white Grapes, the Year that he came to the Empire, began to bring forth Purple colour'd Grapes: ſeveral other ſuch things changed to that Colour. The Preſages of his Death were, That his Father's Sepulchre flew open of it ſelf; his Mother's Ghoſt appeared in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, both to him and to <hi>Florianus,</hi> juſt as if ſhe was Living. All the Gods in the Oratory of his Houſe, whether by an Earthquake or ſome other accident, fell down: An Image of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which he and <hi>Florianus</hi> Worſhipped, was found laid upon the Bed, without any hand to put it there known. Theſe are things that a great many mention: But I conclude this Life.</p>

                     <p>THere is but little to be ſaid of this Prince more, than that being the Brother of the Emperor <hi>Tacitus,</hi> he after his death ſeized upon the Empire, not by the Authority of the Senate, but of his own Motion, as if the Empire was to go to him by Inheritance: though at the ſame time he knew, that his Brother was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured in the Senate, that when he dyed, he ſhould not bequeath the Empire, no, not to his own Children.</p>
                     <p>

                        </note> he was killed at the City of <hi>Tarſus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> by his Soldiers; hearing that <hi>Probus</hi> was ſet up, and that all the Army had declared for him. Indeed <hi>Probus</hi> was ſo great a Man in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52508:389"/> of War, that as the Army had choſe him, ſo the Senate wiſhed for him, and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> made open Acclamations to have him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florianus,</hi> though he had otherwiſe much in him of the Temper of his Brother, was very different from him in this Ambition, and this Thirſt for the Empire. He was profuſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, which his Thrifty Brother blamed in him. They both together reigned ſo ſhort a time, that they look almoſt like two Interrexes, acting betwixt the Reigns of <hi>Aurelian</hi> and <hi>Probus.</hi> Their Statues were ſet up at <hi>Terni,</hi> in <hi>Ombria,</hi> in Marble, thirty Foot high; and likewiſe their Sepulchres did ſometime ſtand there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Without further Preface then, this great and famous Prince <hi>Probus,</hi> who hath ſcarce his equal, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, was born at the City of <hi>Sirmiſh</hi> in <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> or the <hi>Lower Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia.</hi>

                        </note> His Father was not of ſo good Quality as his Mother was. His Eſtate was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; Affinity not great; however as well in his private Life, as after he was Emperor, he made his Noble Actions ſpeak for him. Some ſay, his Father's name was <hi>Maximus;</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſerved very well in the Office of a Centurion; riſe to be a Tribune, and died in <hi>Egypt,</hi> leaving a Wife, a Daughter, and this Son. There is one <hi>Greek</hi> Author, who ſays, that <hi>Probus</hi> was a Relation of the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> who was a moſt Excellent and moſt Noble Prince: which may perhaps be the more Credited, becauſe I find in the Journal of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulus Gallicanus,</hi> that after his death he was buried by <hi>Claudia,</hi> who was the Daughter of <hi>Criſpus,</hi> who was the Brother of <hi>Claudius.</hi> But I leave this to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>The love of the Soldiers towards <hi>Probus</hi> was always very great; he again loved them, and kept them in their Duty, purely by his kindneſs to them. He oftentimes had reſcued them from the great Cruelty of <hi>Aurelian:</hi> he viſited the ſeveral Maniples, and examined their Cloaths and their Shooes; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Booty was at any time taken, he divided it all amongſt them, and reſerved nothing to himſel, but the Darts and the Arms.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52508:396"/> but there was a Horſe, which was neither Handſome nor Large, but the Priſoners ſaid, that he was ſo good a Runner, that he would go a hundred Miles a day, and continue it for eight or ten days together. Every one thought that <hi>Probus</hi> would have kept this Beaſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but <hi>Probus</hi> ſaid, that ſuch a Horſe was fitter for one that was for running away, than a brave Man. He ordered the Soldiers to draw Lots for Him. They writ their Names and put them all into an Urn. Four that were in the Army; were of the ſame Name with himſelf. But he, for his part, put in no Name. They drew, and the firſt Name that came up was, <hi>Probus.</hi> The four Soldiers of the Name of <hi>Probus</hi> not agreeing to which of them the Horſe ſhould go, becauſe each Challenged the Lot, he ordered all the Army to draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: the Lot that came up the ſecond time was <hi>Probus</hi> again, and ſo it was a third time, and a fourth time.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52508:396"/> for thoſe he never ſuffered to be idle. There are of his Works in ſeveral Cities of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which he built by his Soldiers.

                     <p>After the Peace of <hi>Perſia, Probus</hi> returned again into <hi>Thrace;</hi> where, upon the Lands of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire he planted one hundred thouſand of the <hi>Baſtarnae,</hi> who all kept their Faith with him: but others of the Barbarian Nations, of whom he tranſplanted great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in like manner, that is, of the <hi>Gepidi,</hi> the <hi>Grothungi,</hi> and the <hi>Vandals,</hi> all theſe broke their
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52508:402"/> Faith, and whilſt <hi>Probus</hi> was imployed in the Wars with <hi>Saturninus,</hi> and thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Uſurp the Empire from him, they roſe, and found a means to over-run almoſt all parts, by Sea or Land, to the trouble and the diſhonour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name; till <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> at length by ſeveral turns ſet upon them, overcame them, and oppreſſed them, and left to few of them the happineſs of getting home in ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were his Actions with the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. His other Troubles were ſuch, as he ſuffered from the attempts of particular am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Subjects, who were for ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note place="margin">His inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Troubles.</note> up for the Empire: one of whom was <hi>Saturninus,</hi> who uſurped the Empire of the Eaſt, and who engaged <hi>Probus</hi> in ſeveral Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels; till <hi>Probus</hi> by his known Gallantry over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, and with the ſame Conqueſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſuch a firm Peace in the Eaſt, that not a Mouſe dared to ſtir more there. The others who pretended to the Empire in like manner, were <hi>Proculus</hi> and <hi>Bonoſus</hi> at the City of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne;</hi> who challenged to themſelves all the Provinces of <hi>Britain, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Gallia.</hi> But the <hi>Germans</hi> refuſed to aſſiſt them in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. The Arms of <hi>Probus</hi> prevailed over both theſe, of whom, as alſo of <hi>Saturninus</hi> and <hi>Firmus,</hi> a more particular account will follow afterwards by themſelves. After this, <hi>Probus</hi> permitted to all <hi>Gallia, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Pannonia,</hi> the liberty of Planting Vines, and making Wine: he ſet his own Soldiers upon digging the Mountain <hi>Almus,</hi> which is by the City

                        <hi>Sirmium</hi> in the <hi>Lower Pannonia,</hi> and he planted it himſelf with an excellent Grape.</p>
                     <p>Coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he entertained the People<note place="margin">
                           <hi>His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to</hi> Rome.</note> there with the Publick Games and Paſtimes in a manner which was very magnificent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Largeſſes, which he gave amongſt them. He Celebrated a Triumph for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Blemmyae,</hi> and the <hi>Germans</hi> in which he had Troops, to the number of fifty in a Troop, of Men of all Nations that marched before him. He gave an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Chaſe of Beaſts in the Cirque, which was very Generous. The People firſt Hunted, and then ſhared the Beaſts amongſt them. The manner of it was thus; the whole Cirque was turned into the nature of a Foreſt. Great Trees pulled up by the Roots by the Soldiers, were Planted up and down, on Beams co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Earth, the Trees green and freſh: and then by the ſeveral Paſſages which opened into the Cirque, entred a thouſand Oſtriches, a thouſand Stags, a thouſand Boars, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Deer, Evecks, wild Sheep, and other Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batick Animals of as many kinds as could be had; all which the Populace being let in upon them, encountred, and killed, and took every one what they could. Another day he cauſed a hundred great Lions to enter into the Cirque at once, who raiſed a ſort of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with their Roaring. All theſe were killed upon the place, and in theſe Encounters many of the Men, that fought with the Beaſts, by accident have killed one another. Then came forth a hundred <hi>Libyan</hi> Leopards, a hundred
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52508:403"/> other <hi>Syrian</hi> Leopards, a hundred Lioneſſes, and three hundred Bears; the ſight of all which was not to be ſaid ſo grateful, as it was great.

                        <note place="margin">His Death and the Occaſion.</note> the Soldiers plotted together and killed him. The occaſions whereof were theſe. Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he never ſuffered them to lie idle: for he employed them upon many other Works, beſides thoſe of the War, which he finiſhed by their Hands; and ſaid, that Soldiers ought not to eat the Bread of the Country for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The next thing was, that he ſaid, that he hoped in a ſhort time he would make it ſo, that the State ſhould have no need of Soldiers. Which is a great ſaying, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes an extraordinary force of Spirit. <hi>Have no more need of Soldiers!</hi> Why, what is it but to ſay, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhall univerſally Reign and Poſſeſs all things in ſafety? Secure of the whole Earth for their Empire, there ſhall be no more of making Arms, nor gathering Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, nor Convoying Proviſions; the Ox ſhall be kept for the uſe of the Plow, and the Horſe for the Services of Peace; an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Peace! There ſhall be no more Wars, no
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52508:403"/> leading into Captivity; the Laws of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and their Magiſtrates ſhall every where prevail in vigour. My Affection to ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len an Emperor would Tranſport me further, than the Quality of the Style in which I write, does require or permit. But I ſhall only add a third thing, which above all haſtened the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal End of this Great Man. When he came to <hi>Sirmium,</hi> deſiring to Fructiſie and to Dilate the Borders of the place of his Nativity, he ſet ſeveral thouſands of his Soldiers upon the drayning a Fen; which was to be done by making a great Foſs to receive the Waters, and exonerate them by an Out-let into the Sea; and ſo the Ground might become of uſe to the People of <hi>Sirmium.</hi> The Fatigue of this Piece of Work ſo inraged the Soldiers, that they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted him; and as he fled for ſafety into an Iron Tower, which himſelf had built there for a Watch-Tower very high, they killed him in the fifth year of his Reign: however afterwards the Army unanimouſly built him a lofty Sepulchre, whereon in Marble was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved this Inſcription: <hi>Here lies the Emperor</hi> Probus; <hi>who was a Prince of true Probity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Name. The Conqueror of all the Barbarian Nations, and the Conqueror of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Empire in his time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When I compare the Emperor <hi>Probus</hi> with others of the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes his Predeceſſors, and almoſt with all our Great Captains of the former time, whoſe Fortitude; whoſe Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency; whoſe Prudence; whoſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Actions have ſignalized them to Poſterity.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52508:404"/> I am apt to think that this Perſon was equal to them, or if I may ſpeak it without envy, he excelled them. In the five years of his Reign, he finiſhed ſo many Wars, in ſo many ſeveral parts of the World, and all in his own Perſon, that it is a wonderful thing, which way he rendred himſelf ſufficient for all thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He did many Valiant Actions in Battle with his own Hand. He formed ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Commanders. <hi>Carus, Diocleſian, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius, Aſclepiodotus, Annibalian, Leonides, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cropius, Piſonianus, Herennian, Gaudioſus, Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinian, Herculius, Maximian,</hi> and others whom our Fathers have admired, and of whom ſome have ſince approved themſelves good Princes upon the Throne, were All formed by the Diſcipline of <hi>Probus.</hi> Now let any one, who pleaſes, compare with this the twenty years of the Reigns of <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Hadrian:</hi> let him compare as many of the <hi>Antoninuſſes;</hi> or what ſhall I ſay, of the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> becauſe the years of his Reign are ſcarce very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined? Not to mention all ſuch as have been ill Princes! That famous Expreſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of <hi>Probus,</hi> That in a ſhort time there ſhould be no need of Soldiers, ſhews his vaſt deſign, and what he hoped to have been able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. He feared neither the Barbarians abroad, nor Uſurpers at home; he was aſſured of his own Conſcience. And to what a happineſs had we all arrived, if he had lived to make good his words? to have ſeen all the Provinces free from Taxes, no Army to pay, the <hi>Roman</hi> Treaſures abiding Eternal and unexhauſtible,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52508:404"/> nothing ſpent by the Prince, nothing taken upon the Subject! Certainly it would have been a golden Age. We had had no more to do with Camps: no more of the noiſe of Arms, nor of the Hammering them: The Soldiers that now diſquiet the State with Civil-War, would have Cultivated the Fields or followed Navigation, or ſought their Employs in the Arts, and no more blood ſhed! Ye good Gods, in what hath the <hi>Roman</hi> State offended you ſo, that have taken from us ſuch an Excellent Prince. We now run upon Civil-Wars, and Arm Brother againſt Brother, and the Son againſt the Father: but well have our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors done to Conſecrate <hi>Probus</hi> a God, and ſet up his Image in the Temples, and to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate him in the Proceſſion to the Games of the Cirque.</p>

I cannot omit to obſerve, that when an Image of <hi>Probus</hi> at <hi>Verona</hi> was ſo ſtruck with Lightning, that the Robe, in which he was done, changed its Colour, the Soothſayers anſwered thereupon, that thoſe of his Family ſhould be all of them one day of great Note in the Senate, and come to be raiſed unto the higheſt Honours: which may perhaps here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be; but we ſee nothing of it as yet.</p>
                     <p>The Senate received the News of the death of <hi>Probus</hi> with great diſpleaſure, and ſo did the People. But when they heard of the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52508:405"/> of <hi>Carus</hi> in his place, who though he was a good Man, was far diſtant however from the Merits of <hi>Probus,</hi> and had a Son beſide, (<hi>Carinus</hi>) that had always lived ill; both the Senate and the People were ſtruck with a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; becauſe they apprehended the humour of the Father a little; but his wicked Heir much worſe.</p>
                     <p>This is what we have met with, and have thought worthy to be committed to future Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, concerning <hi>Probus.</hi> It remains, that we give next a ſhort, but a diſtinct account of <hi>Firmus, Saturninus, Bonoſus,</hi> and <hi>Proculus.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not fit to mix thoſe four Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Empire, together with the account of this good Prince.

But why <hi>Marius Maximus,</hi> who is the moſt Verboſe of all Men, and who hath not forborn to embaraſs himſelf with tedious Accounts of things, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend even to Fictions and Fables, to fill up his Hiſtory; why he hath not been more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular than he is, in his Deſcriptions of <hi>Avidius Caſſius, Claudius Albinus,</hi> and <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> who pretended to the Empire, the firſt againſt the Emperor <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> the others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> I do not underſtand? On the contrary, <hi>Trebellius Pollio</hi> hath thought fit to be ſo diligent and ſo careful in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52508:406"/> as to thoſe Princes, whether Good or Bad, undertaken by him, that he hath laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a ſeparate Hiſtory of Thirty Pretenders to the Empire, who ſet up themſelves in, or much about the Times of the Emperors <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus</hi> and <hi>Valerian.</hi> And in imitation of his Example, ſince I have already paſſed through the Trouble of the Reigns of <hi>Aurelian, Tacitus, Florianus,</hi> and that great and ſingular Prince <hi>Probus,</hi> I am very willing before I proceed to thoſe of <hi>Carus, Numerian,</hi> and <hi>Carinus,</hi> who ſucceeded the next to the Empire, not to omit to ſay ſomething of <hi>Firmus, Saturninus, Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and <hi>Bonoſus,</hi> who ſet up themſelves in the time of the Emperors <hi>Probus</hi> and <hi>Aurelian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You know, my dear <hi>Baſſus,</hi> what a Diſpute we lately had with one, who is a great lover of Hiſtory, that is, <hi>M. Fonteius;</hi> when he ſaid, that <hi>Firmus,</hi> who poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Aegypt</hi> in the time of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> was a Robber and not a Prince. Againſt which, I, together with me <hi>Rufus Celſus, Cejonius Julianus, Fabius Soſianus,</hi> and <hi>Severus Archontius,</hi> affirmed, that <hi>Firmus</hi> did both actually wear the Purple, as a Prince, and had a Coin ſtamped in his Name, whereof ſome Pieces were produced, and alſo by the <hi>Grecian</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Writings it appears, that in the Edicts which he publiſhed, he is remarked by the Title of Emperor. The only Reaſon which <hi>Fonteius</hi> had to offer againſt this, was; That <hi>Aurelian</hi> did not ſay in his Edict, ſpeaking of <hi>Firmus,</hi> that he had killed a Tyrant or a <hi>Pſeudo</hi> Emperor, but that he had deliver'd the State of a Robber. As if it could
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52508:406"/> be expected, that ſo Renowned a Prince as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> ſhould have given him any better Name. Or, as if all great Princes did not call thoſe Robbers, who Invade their Crowns, and are beaten beſides in the Attempt. Not but that, I remember very well, that in the Life of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> I have repreſented <hi>Firmus,</hi> as one, who did not pretend to the Purple, as an Emperor. For I muſt confeſs, that when I writ that, it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had not then the knowledge of all the things concerning him, which I have attained to ſince. But to be ſhort;</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firmus</hi> was a Native of the City of <hi>Seleucia.</hi> Several <hi>Grecian</hi> Writers do give him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place indeed; but that is a miſtake, into which they are led by this, that there are three at the ſame time of the ſame Name of <hi>Firmus;</hi> whereof one was the Governour of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> the other a Proconſul and a General on the Frontiers of <hi>Africa:</hi> But this <hi>Firmus</hi> was a Friend and an Aſſociate of the Lady <hi>Zenobia;</hi> for whom he, with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> took the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and was at length happily defeated by <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and the wonted bravery of that Prince.</p>
                        <p>There are many things reported of the Riches of this <hi>Firmus.</hi> It is ſaid, that he had the Walls<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vaſt Wealth of</hi> Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> of his Houſe Wainſcoted with Squares of Glaſs, faſtned by <hi>Bitumen,</hi> and other Medicaments. He was the Maſter of ſo much of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of Paper, that he often publickly ſaid, he could maintain an entire Army out of only Paper and Glue. He entertained a great Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the <hi>Blemmyae</hi> and the <hi>Saracens.</hi> He
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52508:407"/> ſent Ships of Merchandize oftentimes into <hi>India.</hi> He had two Elephant's Teeth, ten Foot long; with which, and two others added to them, <hi>Aurelian</hi> who took them, deſigned to make a Chair, wherein to place a Statue of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in Gold, covered with Jewels and a Robe of State, and illuſtrated with Inſcriptions: Which Statue was to be ſet up in the Temple of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and to be entitled, <hi>Jupiter the giver of Good Counſel.</hi> But <hi>Carinus</hi> afterwards poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf of thoſe Teeth, made a Preſent of them to a certain Lady, who uſed them for the Feet of a Bed. I ſay no more, becauſe we of this Age know her; and for Poſterity, it it ſignifies nothing. But thus that <hi>Indian</hi> Rarity, which was Conſecrated to the moſt Excellent and Mighty <hi>Jupiter,</hi> was by a lewd Prince made at once the Purchaſe of a Miſtreſs, and the Scene of the Exerciſe of her too.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firmus</hi> was of a large Stature, with great<note place="margin">His Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.</note> and prominent Eyes, frizled Hair, Scars and Wounds on his Face, a blackiſh Viſage, the reſt of his Body fair enough, but Hairy and Briſtly; ſo that a great many called him a <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clops.</hi> He eat a vaſt deal of Fleſh; ſome ſay, a whole Oſtrich in a day. He drunk not much Wine, but very much Water; and was a Man of a ſtrong Brain and ſo robuſt Nerves, that one might allow him to be ſtronger than the Gladiator <hi>Tritannus</hi> in <hi>Varro.</hi> For he would bear a Smith's Anvil, with Perſons with all their force knocking upon it, upon his Breaſt, as he lay bent in his Body backwards, and only reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Hands and Feet, without touching
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52508:407"/> the ground with his Back. There was once a diſpute betwixt him and ſome of the Officers of <hi>Aurelian</hi> about Drinking. <hi>Burburus,</hi> a moſt noted Drinker, and an old Soldier, challenged him to Drink with him. <hi>Firmus</hi> drank up two large Veſſels full of Wine, and remained all the time after ſober. Says <hi>Burburus</hi> to him, <hi>Why have you not drank up the very Grounds too? You ſilly Creature,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Firmus, no body drinks Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Firmus</hi> therefore aſſumed to himſelf the Quality of an Emperor, in oppoſition to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian;</hi> and maintained the Parts which as yet were remaining to <hi>Zenobia</hi> in the Eaſt. <hi>Aurelian</hi> beat him, in his return from <hi>Heren</hi> in <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia.</hi> Some ſay, <hi>Firmus</hi> afterwards Hanged<note place="margin">His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat and Death.</note> himſelf. But this is diſproved by the Edict of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> which he ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> together with the Notice of his Victory, which was thus.</p>

                        <p>This Man, being known to <hi>Aurelian</hi> to be an excellent Commander, was preferred by that Emperor to be the General on the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Frontier. At the ſame time he wiſely commanded him, never to ſee <hi>Aegypt.</hi> For reflecting, as it is thought, upon the Nature of the <hi>Gauls</hi> on the one hand, and of the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> on the other, he was afraid, that ſhould <hi>Saturninus</hi> come amongſt ſo troubleſome a People as thoſe of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> he might by their Converſation be ſpurred on to thoſe Attempts, to which his <hi>French</hi> Genius it ſelf enough inclined him.</p>

                        <p>He had a Virago to his Wife, who precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated him into the Madneſs of putting up for the Empire.

                        <p>It cannot be denied, but that <hi>Proculus</hi> was an extraordinary and a very brave Man; and had always paſſed his Life under Arms. He had Commanded in the Quality of a Tribune over ſeveral Legions, and had done Actions of great Valour.

                        <p>He ſerved as a Soldier firſt in the Foot, and afterwards in the Horſe. He roſe to be a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, then to be a Tribune, and at laſt to be the General on the Frontier of <hi>Rhaetia.</hi>

                        <p>No Man ever drank like <hi>Bonoſus.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſaid often of him. That<note place="margin">His Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at Drinking.</note> certainly he was born, not to ſay to Live, but particularly to live to Drink. That Emperor however long had him in eſteem, becauſe of his experience in the matter of War. And when any Embaſſadors arrived from the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Nations of what Parts ſoever, it was the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Bonoſus</hi> to drink with them, till in their drink he diſcover'd out of them many times their ſecrets. For <hi>Bonoſus,</hi> let him drink to what exceſs he would, was never concerned: But on the contrary, as <hi>Oneſimus</hi> ſays in his Life of <hi>Probus,</hi> he was even the more prudent and more diſcreet for drinking. Withal he had this particular Quality with him, that as much as he drank, it paſſed from him again. It never was any burden to his Stomach, or his Belly, or his Bladder.</p>
                        <p>It happening one time, that the <hi>Germans</hi> had burnt the Shipping which the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed upon the River <hi>Rhine, Bonoſus,</hi> to avoid the puniſhment which he feared for his Neglect in that matter, ſet up himſelf Emperor.

                     <byline>BY FLAVIUS VOPISCUS.</byline>
                     <p>HOW the Power of Fate reigns over the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſometimes raiſes it to the greateſt heighth, and then humbles it again, and throws it down as much the other way; the Death of the Emperor <hi>Probus</hi> is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient demonſtration. <hi>Probus</hi> had ſucceeded to the Empire after <hi>Aurelian,</hi> by the joynt Voice of the Senate and the People; and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:52508:414"/> whilſt the Laws and the Government were lodged in ſo juſt a Hand, we ſeemed ſecure, conſidering that we had now enjoyed a few good Reigns together of a continued Series of Happineſs to relieve the State, after all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Calamities, and after ſo many changes of Fortune with which it had been toſſed and varied in the courſe of time, in that manner, that it hath ſuffered almoſt all the Events which are incident to any Man, by the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of his Nature.</p>
                     <p>But by a fatal Paſſion of the Soldiers, this ſo acceptable Emperor, <hi>Probus,</hi> was cut off; whoſe loſs was ſo great, that we were no leſs ſtruck at it, than a Man in a Fire or in a Shipwrack; and the Publick was reduced to that deſpair, as that every one feared the Succeſſion of ſome <hi>Domitian, Vitellius</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> in his place. It is natural at any time rather to have Fears than Hopes from the manners of an uncertain Prince: But eſpecially well might a People do ſo, whoſe Wounds were yet green, and who not long ſince had had one of their Emperors (<hi>Valerian</hi>) carried into Captivity; another (<hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus</hi>) given up to Luxury, and about Thirty pretended Princes, in the mean time ſtarting up, and rending the Empire in Pieces by a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War, according as every one challenged the Sovereignty to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>If we take a view of the Changes which the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſuffered from the Foundation of the City, we ſhall find, that never any People hath flouriſhed more by good Fortune, nor yet laboured under worſe. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>

So we flouriſhed to the time of <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud; and then a Storm fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, occaſioned by the arbitrary Vices of that King, which we revenged; but it was not without much hazarding our own Ruine. From thence we paſſed and increaſed to the War of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> when we were over-run with a Flood of the Enemy, the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> excepting only the Capitol taken; and we ſuffered well nigh more hurt now, than we ever enjoyed good, ſince our very Foundation. However, our Commonwealth recovered itſelf from this Blow; but yet it was ſo plagued with the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Wars, and the Terror of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> that it could not be at any reſt for its miſerable Fears. At length, we conquered <hi>Carthage,</hi> and extended our Empire far beyond the Seas; the Senſe of which Felicity was extenuated to us, by our Social Diſcords, and our Civil Wars, under which we ſpent our time, unto <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who repaired the State for us anew, if we may call that yet a Reparation, which was wrought at the Expence of our Liberty. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, although we were ſometime troubled at home, amongſt foreign Nations our Name flouriſhed; and after ſeveral ill Emperors that afflicted us, the State lifted up its Head again
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52508:415"/> under <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> The Happineſs of <hi>Titus</hi> was no ſooner enjoyed than loſt; to whom ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the cruel <hi>Domitian,</hi> whoſe Wounds went deep.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52508:417"/> for he was diſpleaſed with the Manners of <hi>Carinus,</hi> and complains of him in a Letter to the Captain of the Guards, inſomuch that he really had it ſometimes in his mind, what <hi>Oneſimus</hi> ſays, to depoſe him for his ill deſerts, from his <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Dignity again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Carus</hi> ſerved himſelf of the great Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and all the Force of <hi>Probus</hi> for the Wars, which he had before him.

                        <hi>NUMERIANUS,</hi> the Son of <hi>Carus,</hi> was a Perſon extremely well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as to his Manners, and truly worthy of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>He had a ſingular Genius for Eloquence,<note place="margin">His Parts and Learning.</note> both in Proſe and in Verſe. He declaimed in Publick, and was the Author of ſeveral things extant, which are Noble in that kind. In Verſe he exceeded all the Poets of his Age. He diſputed the Bays with the famous <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius Nemeſianus;</hi> and he as far outdid the <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicks</hi> of <hi>Aurelius Apollinaris,</hi> as the Sun out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhines every thing elſe. A Speech which he once ſent unto the Senate, was filled with ſo much Eloquence, that they Voted him a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to be ſet up in the <hi>Ulpian</hi> Library, not as to a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but as an Orator. The Inſcription
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52508:419"/> was, <hi>To</hi> Numerianus Caeſar, <hi>the moſt Powerful Orator of his Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Accompanying his Father to the <hi>Perſian</hi> War, he created himſelf a Sickneſs with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive grief, which he took at his Death; which gave an opportunity to <hi>Arrius Aper,</hi> his Father-in-Law, to kill him as he was in a Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">He is murdered.</note> by which <hi>Aper</hi> deſigned to mount the Throne himſelf in his ſtead. He kept the Murder private for ſeveral days; telling the Soldiers, when they enquired about his Health, that <hi>Numerianus</hi> was not to be ſeen, becauſe he was obliged to keep out of the Wind and the Sun for his ſore Eyes, which he had; till at laſt the Body ſtinking, and the Treachery of <hi>Aper</hi> not being poſſible to be longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, they took him and brought him to the Head of the Army; where after a great Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue upon the occaſion, and a Tribunal raiſed, it was propoſed, who ſhould be the juſt Avenger of the Death of <hi>Numerianus,</hi> and who the Prince to ſucceed to the Throne. All with a Divine Conſent cryed, <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> who then Commanded the Forces of the Houſhold, and had received before already many Preſages of his future Reign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diocleſian</hi> was a Perſonage of great Note, politick, well affected to the State, a lover of his Friends, prepared for all Events as occaſion required; his Counſels always raiſed, yet never Extravagant nor Impudent, becauſe he ſtifled within him the Motions of his unquiet Breaſt, with an extraordinary Obſtinacy. He mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tribunal, and being proclaimed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52508:420"/> the Queſtion next was, How <hi>Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> was Killed? <hi>Aper,</hi> who had been the Captain of the Guards, ſtood by. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> drew his Sword, and ſtriking it through the Body of <hi>Aper</hi> upon the place, ſaid, <hi>This is the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Death revenged.</note> 
                        <hi>Author of the Death of</hi> Numerianus. So <hi>Aper</hi> was ſerved but as his Actions deſerved. My Grandfather hath told me, that he was in the Company, when <hi>Diocleſian</hi> killed him with his own Hand; and he ſaid, as <hi>Diocleſian</hi> made the Blow, he cryed to <hi>Aper, Be proud, that you fall by ſo great a Hand as mine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is Matter of Curioſity, and not common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, I mean the Story, which is proper to be told in this place, of a Preſage that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> of his Elevation to the Empire. My Grandfather hath told me, that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it from <hi>Diocleſian</hi> himſelf. When <hi>Diocleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſerved at the City of <hi>Tongres</hi> in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> where he was then a young Soldier, and in an inferior Poſt, talking with a Woman who was a <hi>Druid,</hi> about his daily Expences at the Inn in which he lodged, ſays ſhe to him, Diocleſian, <hi>you are too Covetous, you are too good a Manager: Diocleſian</hi> in jeſt anſwered, <hi>But I will be Generous when I am an Emperor.</hi> Says ſhe, Diocleſian, <hi>you need make no Jeſt of it: Yes, yes, you will be an Emperor, but you muſt firſt kill a Boar.</hi> From that time <hi>Diocleſian</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had thoughts in his mind of the Empire, as both <hi>Maximian</hi> and my Grandfather knew; to whom he himſelf told this Story; and laughed at it, but not a word to any body elſe. Therefore in Hunting, wherever he could, he
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:52508:420"/> always killed the Boars with his own hand: ſo when <hi>Aurelian, Tacitus, Probus,</hi> and <hi>Carus,</hi> were all made Emperors before him, ſays he, <hi>I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kill the Boars, but another runs away with the Diſh and the ſweet Bit.</hi> But when he had killed <hi>Aper,</hi> which is a Latin Name for a Boar, <hi>Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>at laſt I have killed the Fatal Boar.</hi> And my Grandfather hath ſaid, that <hi>Diocleſian</hi> declared, that he had no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for killing <hi>Aper</hi> with his own hand, but to fulfil the Saying of the <hi>Druid,</hi> and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en himſelf in the Empire: for otherwiſe, eſpecially upon the firſt day of his Reign, he did not deſire to appear ſo Cruel, if ſuch a Neceſſity had not thereunto compell'd him.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>CARINUS</hi> was one of the impureſt of Men. I am aſhamed to repeat, what <hi>Oneſimus</hi> hath written of him. An Adulterer, vicious with Boys whom he frequently debauched, and paſſive in an Act which is it ſelf contrary to the Nature of his Sex.</p>
                     <p>His Father, going to the <hi>Perſian</hi> War, left him to be the Governour over <hi>Gallia, Italy,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:52508:421"/> Illyricum, Spain, Britain,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> under the Title of a Caeſar, but with the full Power of an Emperor. In this Government he ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſhonoured himſelf with enormous Vices and Actions. All the beſt Perſons about him,<note place="margin">His filthy Vices and Luxuries.</note> he baniſhed; and took and kept others in their room, who were of the worſt of Mankind. He made one of his Porters the Governour of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> than which nothing can be thought nor mentioned, more ſhameful. The Captain of the Guards, which he had, he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and into his place he put <hi>Matronianus,</hi> an old Pimp. His Secretary, another of his Pimps, who was always privy to his Luſts, and aſſiſted him in them, he made a Conſul againſt the expreſs Orders of the Emperor his Father. He writ haughty Letters to the Senate; threatned to give away their Eſtates amongſt the Mob of the City. He married Nine Wives, taking one and putting away another; ſeveral of which he put away big with Child. He filled the Court with Mimicks, Courtezans, Actreſſes, Singers and Pimps. He diſdained the ſigning of Diſpatches himſelf; ſo that he kept a wretch who was his Jeſter, always at Noons, to ſign them for him; and many times he played up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him agreeably for imitating his hand well. He wore Jewels upon his Shooes; never wore a Button, but what was of a Jewel. His Belt was often ſet with Jewels. He never did the Conſuls or the great Officers of the State, the Honour to ſtep to meet them coming. The Lewd were much in his Favour, and always invited to his Table. He had ordinarily a
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:52508:422"/> hundred Pound of Birds, the ſame of Fiſh, and a thouſand of Fleſh of ſeveral ſorts at a Meal. He ſpent a great deal of Wine. He ſwam (as I may ſay) amongſt Fruits and Melons. He ſtrew'd his Chambers and his Beds with Roſes. His hot water Baths, when he bathed, were no more than Lukewarm. His cold Baths were of Snow-water. Coming in the Winter to a place where there was a Spring of very warm Water, as it naturally uſes to be the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the Winter, and the Bath being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the ſame, ſays he to the Waiters, <hi>You give me here Woman's Water;</hi> which (they ſay) was one of beſt things he ever ſaid. It would be tedious to tell at large the reſt of his Luxuries. <hi>Fulvius Aſprianus</hi> hath alſo already done it: Let the Reader who deſires to know every thing ſo particularly go to him. The Emperor <hi>Carus</hi> his Father, when he heard how he behaved himſelf, diſowned him, and cried, <hi>He is none of mine.</hi> And had he lived, he would have deprived him of his <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Dignity and Power again. <hi>Oneſimus</hi> ſays, he would have put him to Death, and advanced <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to his place, who was then the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and was afterwards made Caeſar, than whom no Man was fitter for that Honour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Carinus,</hi> after both his Father and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were dead, and <hi>Diocleſian</hi> was ſet up to be Emperor, gave himſelf more than ever to Vice and Extravagance, as if he was now more free, and eaſed of the Tyes of the Examples and domeſtick Admonitions of his Family.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:52508:422"/> However, he wanted not the Vigour of mind to challenge the Empire. He fought for it againſt <hi>Diocleſian</hi> ſeveral Battels. In the laſt<note place="margin">He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and ſlain.</note> of which, a Town in <hi>Maeſia,</hi> he was conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and killed.</p>
                     <p>This was the end of theſe Three Princes, <hi>Carus, Numerian,</hi> and <hi>Carinus.</hi> The Gods have given to us, ſince them, the Emperors <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> to whom they have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily joyned <hi>Galerius</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> whereof the former was born, to deface the ignominy of the Captivity of <hi>Valerian,</hi> and the other to reſtore <hi>Gallia</hi> to the Obedience of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Theſe are the four great Princes of the World, Valiant, Wiſe, Benign, Generous, of one Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent for the Good and Intereſts of the State, always reverencing the Senate, Moderate, Friends of the People, Grave, Good, Religious, and ſuch in fine, as we have ever prayed to have; whoſe Lives are ſeveraliy written by <hi>Claudius Euſthenius,</hi> ſometime Secretary to <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> which I therefore mention, becauſe I would not that ſo great a Work ſhould be expected from me, conſidering the Difficulty of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon living Princes, blameleſs.</p>
                     <p>One thing yet is very memorable in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Emperor <hi>Carus,</hi> and of his two Sons, <hi>Numerian,</hi> and <hi>Carinus.</hi> They adorned the Publick Games, with which they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the People before they went to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> War, with Shews altogether new and ſtrange, which we ſee are painted upon a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery in a part of the Palace, to continue the memory of them to Poſterity. There was a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52508:423"/> Rope-Dancer, who ſeemed, as if he moved or<note place="margin">Strange Shows made to the People.</note> flew in the Air; the Cord on which he danced was ſo very ſmall, you could ſcarce ſee it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man ran upon the edge of a Wall with Dancing Bears at his Heels. There was a Symphony of a hundred Trumpets, a hundred Haut-Boys, a hundred Pipes, a hundred Flutes, with Voices to them; a thouſand Pantomimes, who danced all ſorts of Anticks; others, that were Wreſtlers, Runners, Leapers. There was an Engine which repreſented the Burning of Towns, the Flames whereof taking hold on a part of the Amphitheatre, <hi>Diocleſion</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repaired it, and made it more Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent. Mimicks from all Countries, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to be here. Then there was a ſport per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> Captives of Vaulting upon Horſes, which is as pleaſant as any thing in the World. Then there were thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the <hi>Cyclopaean</hi> Poſtures; and all theſe Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, Players, Sports men, and the <hi>Graecian</hi> Artiſts had Gold and Silver given them, and Garments of Silk. I cannot tell how much the People are ingratiated by ſuch kind of things. But ſure I am, that ſeveral other good Emperors have made no great Account of them. <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> when an Officer commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him theſe very Theatrical and Circen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Games of <hi>Carus,</hi> replied only, <hi>Then</hi> Carus <hi>had laughing enough in his time.</hi> And when <hi>Diocleſian</hi> himſelf exhibited his Games accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtom, he was much more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Liberty which he took, and in the Expence which he was at; he ſaid, thoſe
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:52508:423"/> Diverſions ought to be Chaſt and Modeſt, conſidering the preſence at leaſt of the Cenſor.</p>
                     <p>Now I leave this laſt Paſſage to be read by <hi>Junius Meſſala,</hi> whom I dare be free to blame upon this occaſion. Becauſe he hath ſpent all his Eſtate upon Players, and denied it to his own Heirs. A Gown of his Mother's he gave away to one, a Coat of his Father's to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; a Garment of his Wife's, of Purple, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered in Gold, on which her Name was wrought, he gave to a Piper, who triumphs in it, as in a Spoil of the Nobility of the Donor. What ſhall I ſay of the Linens from <hi>Egypt?</hi> The bright <hi>Tyrian</hi> and <hi>Sydonian</hi> Purples, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with admirable Art and Pains? The fine Stuffs from <hi>Arras,</hi> the Ruſſets of <hi>Canoſa,</hi> and other Cloaths from <hi>Africa?</hi> Riches which were never ſeen upon the Stage before! I am willing to ſpeak all this to the World, purpoſely, that the Gentlemen who give thoſe Publick Sports for the future, may be a little aſhamed to ſpend their Eſtates, in prejudice to their lawful Heirs, upon ſuch a Company of Poltrons.</p>
                     <p>Thus, my honoured Friend, you have now the little Preſent, which I preſume to offer to you, of this Hiſtory. I have often ſaid, that I pretend not to ſhew any thing of Eloquence in the writing, but only a Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to preſerve and to relate Matter of Fact. And therefore if any eloquent Hand ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after pleaſe to go over, and better illuſtrate
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52508:424"/> the Lives of theſe Princes, and ſhall ſupply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Materials for the purpoſe, out of what I have ſaid, I ſhall be very well ſatisfied. In the mean time, I deſire you to be contented with my Services, and to believe that it was my Choice to write in this manner, without Diſputing whether or no, I was able to have done it better.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>DIOCLESIAN</hi> was born at an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure<note place="margin">His Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place and Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Village called <hi>Dioclea</hi> in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> and his Mother was of the ſame Name with the Village. Wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Elevation he was called <hi>Diocles;</hi> but being once ſet at the Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, he gave his Name a turn to the Form of a <hi>Roman</hi> Name and called himſelf <hi>Diocleſian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:52508:425"/>
                     <p>He was for ſome time in the beginning of his Youth, a Servant under <hi>Anullinus,</hi> a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Then he went into the Army; where by his Diligence, his Bravery, and his Conduct, he raiſed himſelf ſo, from one Poſt to another, by degrees, that after the death of <hi>Numerianus,</hi> of which he proteſted he was altogether Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and after the Revenge, as hath been ſaid, which he took upon <hi>Aper</hi> for that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">He is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd Emperor.</note> the Army Proclaimed him Emperor.</p>
                     <p>He accepted the Empire, and the Tribuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Power was conferred upon him, on the <hi>11th.</hi> of the Kalends of <hi>May</hi> in the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 1036, and of Chriſt, 284. Which Year he ordered, by his Soveraign Power, to be made a Publick <hi>Aera,</hi> or Date, from whence to Account the following Times. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians uſed it as far as to the Reign of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> But upon their ſcore, the ſame <hi>Aera</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called the <hi>Aera of the Martyrs,</hi> and with great Reaſon. For from the firſt Year of the Reign of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> the Perſecution which the<note place="margin">He Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> Chriſtians ſuffer'd under him, may very well be dated. It is true, his Reign was not ſo Unhappy to them, at the firſt, as it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But yet no Year ſcarce paſſed, but what was defiled with Chriſtian Blood: which was as the droppings of Rain before a violent Tempeſt, and as a Prologue to the diſmal Tragedy that followed after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sabinus Julianus,</hi> who had ſet up for the Empire in <hi>Italy,</hi> after the death of <hi>Carus,</hi> was beaten to <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s hand by <hi>Carmus,</hi> and ſlain in the Plains of <hi>Verona.</hi> In the next place, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi>
                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:52508:425"/> having entirely defeated <hi>Carinus</hi> alſo, in <hi>Moeſia,</hi> he then remained the ſole Lord of all, and was left to enjoy the whole Empire to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without the leaſt Competitor.</p>
                     <p>One thing is very New and Unexpected, which is to be obſerved in the beginning of this Prince's Reign; which is, That he Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all Perſons that had been engaged on the ſide of either <hi>Carinus,</hi> or <hi>Julianus.</hi> He deprived none of them of their Fortunes, Fame, or Honours. A Clemency, that after a Civil War, had not in the Memory of Man been known to have been ſhewn before.</p>
                     <p>He created <hi>Maximian</hi> Caeſar, and ſent him<note place="margin">Maximian <hi>pacifies</hi> Gaul.</note> with an Army into <hi>Gallia,</hi> to ſuppreſs the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, that were there occaſioned by <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and <hi>Helianus,</hi> being at the head of a Party of Ruſticks and Robbers. <hi>Maximian</hi> diſcharged himſelf well of this Commiſſion. By ſlight Skirmiſhes, which he took his opportunity to make with them, he quieted all things in <hi>Gallia,</hi> without any damage to his Army. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters were frightned with the bare report of his march to them. At the ſame time, the <hi>Franks</hi> and the <hi>Saxons</hi> annoyed the Quarters of <hi>Belgium</hi> and <hi>Armorica:</hi> againſt whom <hi>Carauſius</hi> was employed, who repulſed them, and took from them a great deal of Riches and good Booty; the profit whereof he ingroſſed to himſelf, without laying it out for the good of the Provinces, or returning it, as he ought, into the Publick Treaſury. Therefore <hi>Carau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was ordered to be ſeized and put to death. But he eſcaped immediately into <hi>Great Britain,</hi>
                        <pb n="342" facs="tcp:52508:426"/> and gathering together there an Army, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted, and was declared Emperor.</p>
                     <p>There were now many Wars growing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the hands of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> which he knew not, whether he might be able to ſuſtain alone. The <hi>Sarmatians</hi> made great impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon <hi>Pannonia,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> Uſurped upon the Provinces of the Eaſt, the <hi>Allemans</hi> and the <hi>Burgundians</hi> were preparing to break vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently into <hi>Gallia, Carauſius</hi> continued to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Quality of Emperor in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> So <hi>Diocleſian</hi> advanced <hi>Maximian</hi> from a Caeſar, to be Emperor in conjunction with him: and againſt the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> he repaired in Perſon himſelf, to whom having made appear the Power and Glory of his Arms, he paſſed on from thence into <hi>Armenia,</hi> where he br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ke the Force of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and obliged them to ſue for a Peace. <hi>Maximian</hi> in the mean time op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Motions of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in <hi>Gallia,</hi> till they even mouldered away of themſelves, and were deſtroyed by Famine and Peſtilence. But yet others of them renewing their Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the next Year, and paſſing over the <hi>Rhine</hi> upon the Ice into <hi>Gallia, Maximian</hi> had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of driving them back to whence they came; and not that only, but he followed them over the <hi>Rhine</hi> by a Bridge which he erected, and laid <hi>Germany</hi> waſte as far as to the Fountains of the <hi>Danube.</hi> With the like ſucceſs <hi>Diocleſian</hi> being returned out of <hi>Armenia,</hi> expelled the <hi>Goths</hi> from <hi>Thrace,</hi> and ſecured the Paſſage of the River againſt them by three Forts, which he built.</p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:52508:426"/>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed, <hi>Achilleus</hi> aſſumed the Purple upon him, at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and likewiſe a People called the <hi>Quinquegenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or a Confederacy of five Cities in <hi>Africa,</hi> were upon the Revolt, and other Wars threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from other Parts the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> gave a Meeting to each other at the City of <hi>Milan;</hi> where they agreed upon two Perſons, whom to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <hi>Caeſars</hi> for their aſſiſtance; who were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>Chlorus,</hi> and <hi>Galerius Maximianus.</hi> The firſt was appointed for the direction of <hi>Gallia</hi> and the recovery of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the other for the defence of the Banks of the <hi>Iſther;</hi> whilſt <hi>Diocleſian</hi> charged himſelf with the Affairs of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and the Eaſt, and <hi>Maximian</hi> had the care of <hi>Italy</hi> and of the War of <hi>Africa.</hi> All three reverencing <hi>Diocleſian</hi> as their common Father.</p>
                     <p>Purſuant to this Diſtribution, <hi>Diocleſian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and there levelled the Cities of the <hi>Thebais</hi> to the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſtantius</hi> expelled <hi>Carauſius</hi> out of <hi>Gallia,</hi> whither he was then advanced; but as <hi>Carauſius</hi> by flight, arrived again in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> he was killed by one of his own Friends and chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, <hi>Alectus,</hi> after he had held the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Province almoſt ſeven Years; and <hi>Alectus</hi> ſet up himſelf in his ſtead, Againſt whom <hi>Conſtantius</hi> prepared a Fleet in order to attack him at once by Sea and Land; aſſiſted by <hi>Aſclepiodotus</hi> the Captain of the Guards; who overcoming <hi>Alectus,</hi> after he had reign'd about three Years, that Victory finiſhed the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52508:427"/> Reduction of the Iſland of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximian,</hi> paſſing with his Forces into <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> eaſily drove before him the <hi>Quinquegentiani.</hi> They fled for ſhelter into their inacceſſible Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: but being forced to come to a Battel in the next Seaſon, he Vanquiſh'd them, took them Priſoners, and diſpoſed of them at his diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe <hi>Galerius</hi> obtained a ſignal Victory, in his Diviſion, over the <hi>Baſtarnae</hi> and the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matians;</hi> in which <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the Son of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius Chlorus</hi> by <hi>Helena,</hi> ſo Nobly ſignalized his Youth, as to take the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> General Priſoner, and bring him alive to <hi>Galerius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this <hi>Diocleſian</hi> Commanded <hi>Galerius</hi> out of <hi>Pannonia</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſent him to Encounter the Tyrant <hi>Achilleus,</hi> who was not as yet oppreſſed there. <hi>Galerius</hi> Engaging and overcoming him about <hi>Peluſium,</hi> or <hi>Belvais, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilleus</hi> fled for refuge into <hi>Alexandria;</hi> but <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> followed him and beſieged him in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi> and obliging that City to ſurrender to him upon diſcretion in eight days, by the order of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> it was demoliſhed, and expoſed to free Plunder, and <hi>Achilleus</hi> was caſt to the Wild Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>The War of <hi>Aegypt</hi> having detained <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Egypt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd.</hi>
                        </note> in thoſe Parts no leſs than ſix Years, <hi>Narſes</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> was encouraged in the mean time to commence a new War in the Eaſt, and to make his Incurſions into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Armenia.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Diocleſian</hi> ſent <hi>Galerius</hi> away into the Eaſt; who came to <hi>Antioch</hi> with a good Army, and had the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:52508:427"/> better of <hi>Narſes</hi> in two Battels. But raſhly venturing the fortune of a third, on a time when his Force was become much reduced, he was ſo well beaten, that he loſt almoſt entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all his Men, and with difficulty eſcaped with his own Life. He came to <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> who received him in a manner, which was to let him know, that he highly reſented his Conduct, and he was ſcarce willing to truſt him with another Army to give him an opportunity to repair his diſgrace. However <hi>Galerius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the leave to try his Fortune once more againſt <hi>Narſes;</hi> and this time he gave the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> ſuch a rout, that he took the Wife, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>totally routed;</hi>
                        </note> and Children of <hi>Narſes</hi> Priſoners, and obliged him to a Peace upon the Conditions, of returning back to the <hi>Romans</hi> all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces that he had Uſurped from them, and to take the <hi>Tygris</hi> for the Boundary of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                     <p>Altogether the ſame Fortune did <hi>Conſtantius</hi> meet with in the Eaſt, of being firſt overcome by, and then of overcoming the <hi>Germans.</hi> They paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> upon the Ice, and gave him ſuch a blow on a ſudden, that he fled wounded to the next Garriſon in that precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy and that danger, that the Gates being ſhut, he was forced to be haled upon the Walls by a Rope: but yet Rallying again preſently, and engaging the Enemy with ſome freſh Men<note place="margin">
                           <hi>and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the</hi> Germans.</note> and a freſh Courage, he killed to the number of Sixty thouſand of them upon the place.</p>
                     <p>Theſe great and repeated Victories elevated the Pride of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> to a heighth, that not
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:52508:428"/> contented, neither with the Habit which had been uſually worn by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, nor with the accuſtomed Reverences that were paid them, he decorated his Perſon with Jewels and Cloth of Gold; he cauſed his Enamell'd Shoes to be kiſſed, and himſelf to be Adored, and to be called a God and Lord; which none of his Predeceſſors had done, ſince <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When he triumph'd in great Pomp at <hi>Rome,</hi> in conjunction with <hi>Maximian,</hi> he entitled himſelf <hi>Jovius;</hi> and <hi>Maximian, Herculius:</hi> As if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was a ſecond <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Hercules.</hi> He Triumph'd over the <hi>Goths, Baſtarnae, Quadi, Sarmatians, Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Perſians: Maximian</hi> over the <hi>Franks, Allemans, Britains</hi> and <hi>Mauritanians.</hi> And their Triumphal Chariot was preceded by the Captive Siſters and Children of the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is what hath occurred to me, as to the Military part of the Life of <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> For by the loſs of the Commentaries of <hi>Claudius Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenius,</hi> his Secretary, before mention'd by <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcus;</hi> and by the deplorable loſs of other the like Originals, it is very viſible, that a great many Particulars of both <hi>Diocleſian, Maximian, Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Galerius,</hi> are wholly buried in Oblivion.</p>
                     <p>To proceed therefore, to what remains. Theſe two Emperors publiſhed an Edict, which bears date from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the day before the Kalends of <hi>April,</hi> and which is directed to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> the Proconſul of <hi>Africa,</hi> againſt the baſe and infamous Sect, as it calls them, of the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:52508:428"/> 
                        <hi>Manichees.</hi> They order them to be entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated; the Heads and Chieftains of them, together with their abominable Writings, to be burnt; their Followers to be ſent to the Mines, or otherwiſe puniſhed with Death; and all their Eſtates to be confiſcated into the Treaſury.</p>
                     <p>As to the Chriſtians, they publiſhed an Edict in the Year 286. whereby they forbad any Perſon to be allowed to Buy, or Sell, or Grind, or draw Water, who refuſed to burn Incenſe before the Statues of the Gods. But this Edict<note place="margin">The Edict againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> touched only, for the preſent, the Chriſtians who lived at <hi>Rome.</hi> It is not underſtood to have been enjoyned to be obſerved over all the Empire. The Fire was kindled by degrees: till being continually blown up from the mouths of the Gentile Prieſts and the Philoſophers and others, who could not perſwade themſelves to forego the Trade of the gainful Sacrifices and Idols of the Gentile Religion; and there never wanting more and more Fuel to feed the Flame, it came at laſt to an Univerſal Conflagration.</p>
                     <p>The Particulars, it is not for this place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. It is ſufficient to ſay, That it was the moſt Unmerciful, Inhumane, Dire, Outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Scene of Barbarity, that ever the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held; and ſpilt more blood, in a manner, that was to the laſt degree baſe and diſhonourable to the Actors, but glorious to the Sufferers, than had been ſpilt before in a thouſand Wars.</p>
                     <p>A Legion of <hi>Thebaean</hi> Soldiers, who had been employed in <hi>Syria</hi> againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> and by having been uſed to Winter in <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> had been brought to embrace the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52508:429"/> Chriſtian Religion, was in the Year 297, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out of the Eaſt to ſerve under <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> in <hi>Gallia.</hi> The Tribune was <hi>Mauricius,</hi> the Standard-bearer <hi>Exuperius,</hi> and among the reſt there was one <hi>Candidus,</hi> a Senator. They were a compleat Legion of 6666 Stout Men, well appointed. So <hi>Maximian,</hi> going to meet the Enemy, commanded the uſual Sacrifices to be offered to the Gods, the whole Army to be purged, and all the Soldiers to burn Incenſe; which this Legion, being Chriſtians, refuſing, they were decimated once: that is, every tenth Man drawn out and put to death. But this could not alter their Principles. They were decimated a ſecond time: but neither ſo, were they to be removed from their Religion. Then they were ſurrounded by the Army, and all ſlain in their own Camp, at a Place called <hi>Agaunum</hi> in <hi>Gallia,</hi> whither they were retired, the diſtance of eight Miles from the Camp of <hi>Maximian;</hi> but aſſuring him, that excuſing them their Religion, they were always ready to return unto his Camp again, and to Act as bravely as any againſt the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>It was by the Hands and Labours of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Soldiers, that <hi>Maximian</hi> raiſed thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Structures of the Baths of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Baths of his own Name at <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Palace at <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and the Amphitheatre at <hi>Verona.</hi> For he condemned them to any the moſt ſervile Offices.</p>
                     <p>As he aſſiſted, upon the fifteenth of the Kalends of <hi>May</hi> in the Year 301. at the Games
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52508:429"/> of the Cirque, the Populace, who knew very well that they could not do any thing to oblige him more, cryed, <hi>Let the Chriſtians be cut off:</hi> and repeated it twelve times. <hi>May it pleaſe your Majeſty, let there be no Chriſtians.</hi> They repeated this ten times. Therefore <hi>Eugenius Hermogenianus,</hi> the Captain of the Guards, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Matter to the Senate; who reſolving it in the Affirmative, <hi>Maximian</hi> iſſued out his Reſcript for their Exciſion, directed to <hi>Venuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> the day before the Kalends of <hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, came out the General Edict of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> to <hi>Aboliſh the Aſſemblies of the Chriſtians in all places whereſoever they were; to raze their Churches to the ground, to burn their Scriptures, to ſecure their Eccleſiaſticks, to deprive them of all Honours, Offices and Liberties, and by all the means imaginable to force them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Worſhip of the Gods.</hi> Infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon this, in all Parts, periſhed. In <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> alone 140000 were Martyred, and 700000 Baniſhed. Columns were ſet up over all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the Names of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> vainly boaſting, that they had extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Chriſtian Name. Whereas, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they had propagated it, and confirmed it. For the Blood of the Martyrs was the Seed of the Church; and the Chriſtians ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all this with a Virtue, never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, never to be expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diocleſian</hi> himſelf lived to know, that his Enterprize was impracticable. He fell into a
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52508:430"/> Melancholy, quitted the Purple which others have ſo dearly bought, Created <hi>Galerius</hi> at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia</hi> Emperor in his ſtead, and retired for his own part to the City of <hi>Salona</hi> in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia:</hi> where after a Private Life of 9 Years,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Death of</hi> Diocleſian</note> he died, ſome ſay he Poiſoned himſelf, and the <hi>Romans</hi> conſecrated him a God. He had reigned 20 Years, and lived to the Age of 68.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximian,</hi> at the perſwaſion of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> concurred with him in this his laſt unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented Action. They both Abdicated the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in a day. <hi>Maximian</hi> created in his ſtead <hi>Conſtantius</hi> Emperor at <hi>Milan,</hi> and went and lived a Private Life in the Province of <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi>

                     <p>THERE is the leſs to be ſpoken of theſe two Princes in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a great part of their Actions hath been repreſented already in the Account of the Emperors fore-going, under whom they ſerved, and who advanced them ſucceſſively
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:52508:431"/> to the Dignity firſt of Caeſars, and then of Emperors.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I ſhall only here take notice, that at the ſame time that they were created Caeſars, they were obliged to put away their Wives, to whom they were already married; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marry, for a Tye of Affinity, into the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian. Conſtantius</hi> diſmiſſed himſelf from <hi>Helena,</hi> by whom he had had <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who was afterwards the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married to <hi>Theodora,</hi> who was Daughter-in-Law to <hi>Maximian.</hi> In like manner <hi>Galerius</hi> re-married to <hi>Valeria,</hi> who was the Daughter of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> but ſhe did not live long with him; and to conſecrate her Memory to futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity after her Death, her Father impoſed her Name on a part of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> which he called the Province of <hi>Valeria;</hi> and alſo he gave her Name to a City ſituated upon the Banks of the <hi>Danube.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was the Son of a Daughter of <hi>Criſpus,</hi> who was the Brother of the Emperor <hi>Claudius.</hi> He was created the Caeſar, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Maximian,</hi> to whom he ſucceeded in the Government of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and <hi>Galerius</hi> was the Caeſar properly to <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> to whom he ſucceeded in the Empire of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> But as <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was a Prince endowed with all the fine and good Qualities in the World, it is certain that he neither when he was a Caeſar, not when Emperor, dipped his Hands in the Blood of the Chriſtians, which all the other Three laboured to ſpill with ſo much greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52508:432"/> He could not indeed contradict the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of thoſe about them, but yet he mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the matter in their Favour as much as poſſible, and the Deſtruction was always the leſs where he came. <hi>Galerius,</hi> one day, urging him on to be as violent upon it as his Brethren, he publiſhed an Order for all Perſons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his Court, who would not ſacrifice. But ſuch Chriſtians, as for fear, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſtaying in his Court, complied, he blamed and turned out of it; and ſuch as had choſen rather to depart, than Sacrifice, he re-called and retained them, ſaying; <hi>He could not doubt of their Fidelity to him, who were ſo True to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is this other Paſſage, that ſhews the Goodneſs of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> not to be omitted. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi> had blamed very much his Negligence, and reproached him with being a poor Prince, becauſe he had no Money in his Treaſury. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> deſired the Envoys, who had brought him that Meſſage, only to ſtay a little, and they ſhould ſee more of this matter. In the mean time, he ſignified his deſire to all his States, to furniſh him with Money. They fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Coffers immediately, and with a Zeal, in which every one had an emulation to excel. Then ſhewing to the Envoy of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> his Riches, he ſaid, <hi>His Subjects Money was all at his Devotion; but he never thought it ſafer, than when they were the Keepers of his Treaſury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galerius</hi> was by his Birth a <hi>Dacian</hi> of mean Parentage. He was called <hi>Armentarius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:52508:432"/> at the firſt in his Youth, he was but a Keeper of Cattel. His Mother's Name was <hi>Romula,</hi> from which he took an occaſion to call the place of his Birth <hi>Romulianus,</hi> and he pretended to ſay, that his Mother when ſhe conceived of him, was impregnated by a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. He was of a tyrannical Diſpoſition, and much addicted to the Magicks. He was particularly bloody upon the Chriſtians of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia.</hi> But coming to die by a Diſeaſe which conſumed his Secret Parts, and rotted out his Eyes, and parted his Fleſh from his Bones, he was ſo ſenſible of the Hand of God in it, that he countermanded the Perſecution, and begged the Prayers of the Chriſtians unto God for him.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the moderate <hi>Conſtantius</hi> contented himſelf with the Adminiſtration of no more than <hi>Gallia, Spain</hi> and <hi>Great Britain, Galerius</hi> thought fit to create two Caeſars, the one to preſide over <hi>Italy,</hi> the other to go into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who were his two Siſter's Sons, <hi>Flavius Valerius Severus,</hi> and <hi>Galerius Maximin.</hi> In which Promotion, pretermitting <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> by <hi>Helena,</hi> who had all along ſerved under him; and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> together with his Reſentments of that, ſuſpecting a Deſign againſt his Perſon, he made his eſcape from him, and fled into <hi>Great Britain</hi> to his Father, who was arrived there out of <hi>Gallia,</hi> in order to make War upon the <hi>Caledonians</hi> and the <hi>Picts.</hi> His Father with Joy embraced him, and by the Conſent of all the Forces appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and declared him his Succeſſor; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:52508:433"/> after that, his Father dying at the City of <hi>York</hi> the Eighth of the Kalends of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the Year Three Hundred and Six; then commenced the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was Emperor not much above one Year, <hi>Galerius</hi> reigned about ſix; and both had been before thirteen years Caeſars. They finiſhed the vaſt Structure of the Baths of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian,</hi> which was a Work from the beginning, of ſeven years. <hi>Galerius</hi> did a great deal of good to the Province of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> by cutting down the Woods, and converting them into Fields, and by opening a Mouth for the Lake <hi>Pelſo,</hi> to fall into the <hi>Danube.</hi> He created <hi>Licinius</hi> Emperor in Conjunction with him, towards the end of his Reign, and ſet him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Illyricum</hi> and <hi>Thrace;</hi> being one who was his Country-man, a <hi>Dacian,</hi> and who had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized himſelf well under him in the Wars of <hi>Perſia.</hi> And then <hi>Gallerius</hi> died in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which hath been ſaid, in the Year three hundred and eleven.</p>

               <p>TO underſtand how far <hi>Vulcatius Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> had engag'd himſelf to give us the Hiſtory of the times wherein he lived, we need only have recourſe to thoſe words of his, in the Life of <hi>Avidius Caſſius,</hi> which is the only one he has left us, <hi>viz. I deſign,</hi> ſays he, to Diocleſian Auguſtus, <hi>to write the Lives of all thoſe, who, either juſtly or unjuſtly, have been ſtiled Emperor, to the end, to repreſent as it were at once to your view, all that have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the Imperial Dignity, or been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the Title of</hi> Auguſtus. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he never accompliſhed that Deſign, ſince <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> (as I before mentioned) tells us, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf, that he was the firſt that ever writ the Life of <hi>Aurelian;</hi> and we may ſafely conclude that <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> lived ſome time after <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catius,</hi> ſince he makes mention of <hi>Trebellius Pollio,</hi> at the beginning of the Life of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and of <hi>Julius Capitolinus,</hi> and <hi>Aelius Lampri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52508:449"/> at the beginning of the Life of <hi>Probus.</hi> But thoſe were all contemporary with <hi>Vulcatius.</hi> But it may not be unworthy our obſervation, that among the antient Collections of the Works of <hi>Spartian,</hi> in the <hi>Palatine</hi> Library, we find that of <hi>Avidius Caſſius,</hi> attributed there to him, as the Learned <hi>Salmaſius</hi> has remarked, who ſeems inclinable to think that they are one and the ſame Author, both by reaſon of the time wherein he lived, and of the Stile, and ſame Deſign of the Hiſtory; becauſe, as <hi>Lampridius</hi> relates, he had propoſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We may add to this, that as it is certain that <hi>Lampri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> never accompliſh'd his Deſign, ſo the Author of the Life of <hi>Caſſius</hi> has alſo left his imperfect. For as I have already ſaid, <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> maintains that no one before him had written the Life of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> and he has made no mention at all of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catius,</hi> when he had a very fair Opportunity of doing it, where he tells us; <hi>That in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, he would content himſelf to imitate</hi> Gargilius Martialis, Julius Capitolinus, Aelius Lampridius, <hi>and others, who, in what they had tranſmitted to Poſterity, had been more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant of the Truth of the Hiſtory, than of elegance of Style.</hi> But it may be ſaid, that he alſo comprehended <hi>Vulcatius</hi> in theſe words, <hi>and
<pb facs="tcp:52508:450"/> others,</hi> &amp;c. and that he would not expreſs the Name of this Author, becauſe though he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to himſelf to write of all the Emperors, yet that might only be perhaps out of ſome ſort of Emulation of <hi>Spartianus,</hi> and that there is great probability, he contented himſelf with only the Life of <hi>Avidius,</hi> or perhaps ſome one more that may be ſince loſt. To this alſo may be added, that if this Life of <hi>Caſſius</hi> had not been written by <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catius,</hi> how comes it about that it never went under th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Moreover, beſides thoſe three or four Lives, <hi>Spartianus</hi> writ ſome other between them and that of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> whereof he makes mention in the beginning of the Life of <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi> and yet notwithſtanding did not Compoſe the Lives of all the Emperors down to <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> or to <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> as one may eaſily gueſs from the Life of <hi>Aurelian</hi> written by <hi>Vopiſcus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, as far as I ſee, we may without much difficulty Concede that <hi>Aelius Spartianus,</hi> and <hi>Aelius Lampridius</hi> were the ſame Perſon, under three names, as I have ſaid before. And if this, or both, were of the Family of the <hi>Aeliani,</hi> from which the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> alſo was deſcended, their Original was illuſtrious enough: but this is all very uncertain, and we can draw no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Concluſions from it.</p>

               <head>Trebellius Pollio.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt Edition of this Author which was at <hi>Milan,</hi> we find him called <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellius,</hi> and not <hi>Trebellius,</hi> according to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventinus</hi>'s Correction, in the ſecond Book of his Annals, where he ſpeaks of Ancient Writers: But that, in the Opinion of <hi>Voſſius,</hi> was not at all neceſſary, <hi>For among Ancient Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſays he, you may find, <hi>Trebellius Peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus, Trebellius Marinus,</hi> Proconſul, <hi>Trebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Tyche,</hi> and ſuch like. We may add that <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius</hi> is formed from <hi>Trebius,</hi> which is very frequently found among the ſaid Inſcriptions, as <hi>Trebius Germanus, Trebius Longus, Trebia C. F. Filumena.</hi> Nay, as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> remarks, there are ſome Ancient Manuſcripts to be ſeen, wherein this very Author is called <hi>Trebius Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.</hi> Be it as it will, This <hi>Pollio,</hi> ſays <hi>Flavius Vopiſcus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Aurelian, Has Compoſed an Hiſtory of the Emperors both thoſe that have render'd themſelves famous, and thoſe that have led obſcure Lives, down from the two</hi> Philips <hi>to</hi> Claudius, <hi>and his Brother</hi> Quintilius. But there remains of this Authors, neither the Lives of the <hi>Philips,</hi> nor the Life of <hi>Decius,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the <hi>Philips;</hi> neither thoſe of <hi>Gallus</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:52508:452"/> 
                  <hi>Voluſianus,</hi> who came after <hi>Decius.</hi> Alſo we have only one part left of the Life of <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus</hi> the Father, towards the end: but we have that which follows, and alſo the Life of <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus</hi> the Son, the Lives of the two <hi>Gallieni,</hi> and of the thirty Tyrants who uſurped the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the time of <hi>Gallienus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to his Book, which he Entitles of the thirty Tyrants, it ſeems to have a reſpect to the thirty Tyrants which Commanded in <hi>Athens</hi> after <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander;</hi> and without doubt this Author had a fanſie to parallel the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire with that State, in having alſo thirty Tyrants in the time of <hi>Valerianus</hi> and <hi>Gallienus,</hi> becauſe there were ſeveral. But he reckons no more than twenty nine, wherefore to make up the number of thirty he adds <hi>Valens</hi> to them, who liv'd before, and indeed he himſelf owns that he revolted in the time of <hi>Decius.</hi> But if we may exceed the time of <hi>Valerianus,</hi> and <hi>Gallienus,</hi> we may add a great many more beſides <hi>Valens.</hi> Howſoever ſo ſmall a fault as this ſcarce deſerves Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing upon the Judgment of this Hiſtorian: and there is yet leſs reaſon to reflect on him for his admitting two Women into his Liſt of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, <hi>viz. Zenobia</hi> and <hi>Victoria:</hi> for it is common to denominate things from the Nobler Gender; thus you ſee Women admitted into the number of Illuſtrius Poets, as <hi>Sappho</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinna;</hi> but for this <hi>Trebellius</hi> excuſes himſelf at the latter end of his Work. He liv'd in the time of <hi>Conſtantius Chlorus,</hi> Father of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinus,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52508:453"/> as we may eaſily Conjecture, ſince he mentions him in the beginning of the Life of the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> Brother of <hi>Quintilius.</hi> Which agrees very well with what he ſays of his Uncles being a Familiar Friend of the young <hi>Tetricus</hi> one of the thirty Tyrants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> commends the diligence of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian at the beginning of the Life of <hi>Firmus.</hi> Furthermore, if we conſider the time wherein he lived, his Language and Stile are not unworthy of praiſe, whereof <hi>Geſner</hi> in the firſt Tome of his <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> gives this Encomium, that they are not without both Politeneſs and Nicety; but that in ſome places his Stile riſes a little too high for Hiſtory: and <hi>Voſſius</hi> is of the ſame Opinion.</p>

               <head>Flavius Vopiſcus.</head>
               <p>THIS Author, a <hi>Sicilian</hi> Born at <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi> has writ the Life of the Emperor <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Florianus;</hi> to which he likewiſe adds that of <hi>Probus,</hi> which he Dedicates to <hi>Rufus Celſus,</hi> as he calls him in the Life of <hi>Firmus.</hi> Afterwards he Compoſed thoſe of the four Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, <hi>Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſus,</hi> and laſtly thoſe of the three Emperors <hi>Carus, Numerianus,</hi> and <hi>Carinus</hi> at once, which is all remains of his; for we have no Author that attributes any thing elſe to him. As for the time wherein he liv'd we have ſufficient Authorities to aſcertain it. He tells us himſelf that his Uncle was preſent at that Harangue made when <hi>Aper</hi> was killed by <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> In the Life of <hi>Carinus</hi> he Celebrates the praiſes of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian,</hi> of <hi>Galerius</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi> and ſays that each of their Lives was written in ſo many particular Books by <hi>Claudius Euſthenius,</hi> Secretary to <hi>Diocleſian:</hi> And ſays on that very Subject, it muſt not be Expected that he ſhould do the ſame, <hi>becauſe it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Write the Hiſtories of Princes while they are alive.</hi> Whence it is Evident that he
<pb facs="tcp:52508:454"/> lived after the time <hi>Conſtantius Chlorus,</hi> Father of <hi>Conſtantinus.</hi> And he ſays in the Life of <hi>Aurelian, We have at preſent</hi> Conſtantius <hi>for our Emperor.</hi> But I am apt to think that that was the firſt Life he Writ, and that he Compoſed that of <hi>Carinus</hi> after the death of <hi>Conſtantius:</hi> for if it be not ſo, in the room of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> we muſt read the Emperor <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> or elſe underſtand <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> Son of the ſaid <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinus.</hi> But the firſt of theſe two Opinions is far the moſt probable; and certainly, by thoſe words which we find in the Life of <hi>Probus,</hi> it is Evident that he Writ long before that the life of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> viz. <hi>But ſince no other undertakes it, I cannot ſuffer, after having been the only Perſon that has Writ the Life of</hi> Aurelian <hi>(which I did as exactly as I could) and having alſo Compoſed the Lives of</hi> Tacitus <hi>and</hi> Florie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>that that of</hi> Probus, <hi>and the memory of his glorious Actions ſhould lye buried in ſilence. If I live I deſign alſo to write all the Lives of the Princes ſince his time down to</hi> Maximia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and</hi> Diocleſian. Methinks we have reaſon to praiſe, in <hi>Vopiſcus,</hi> beſides his Learning, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he always obſerves, in the recital of what he Writes; which <hi>Spartianus, Capitoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and the other Authors of the Imperial Hiſtory have not took ſo much care of, ſince in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeveral, Affairs therein are far more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. He had likewiſe propoſed to himſelf to Write the Life of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> whoſe Sorceries the Gentiles made uſe of to oppoſe, and ſet up againſt the true Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in the Life of <hi>Aurelian</hi> he calls that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
<pb facs="tcp:52508:454"/> 
                  <hi>A Perſon who had acquir'd a vaſt Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Wiſdom, in the ancient Opinions of the Philoſophers, a real Friend of Truth, and worthy of Divine Honours.</hi> And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after. <hi>What Perſon was ever ſeen more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more venerable, more poſſeſſed of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Ancients, and more Divine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men? He reſtored Life to the Dead, and both ſpoke, and did many things above the reach of human Power.</hi> But if any one would know more as to the particulars, let him read thoſe <hi>Grecian</hi> Authors who have written his Life. From theſe words it is eaſie to gueſs, what a Rhapſody of Lies we might have expected from <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> concerning this Perſon, whom he ſo much admired, if he had writ his Life, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after promiſes in Language which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtifies the Veneration he paid to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
